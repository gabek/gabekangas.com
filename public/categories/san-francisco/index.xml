      <description>Like everybody else, I felt like I had heard every song on Pandora by the time I discovered Rdio. I was user number 4075, a paid unlimited user, signing up on June 6, 2010. I was really happy to hear anything I wanted. I used the Rdio Desktop client to create a collection on the service with my local iTunes Library. I listened to it a lot.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s time for my mostly-annual &#34;stuff and things&#34; post. I&#39;ve missed some years, but I think I have more new stuff this time around. I&#39;ll try and detail all of the software, hardware and services that I&#39;ve used this year to make my personal and professional life better or more interesting.
Software
 Desktop (OS X)   Xcode.
Love it or hate it, I live in it. Actually, I don&#39;t know if I love it or hate it.</description>

      <description>I was asked a few weeks back why I haven&#39;t written a post on my blog since I&#39;ve been to San Francisco. I mean, there must be a lot of stuff to talk about, right? It&#39;s a pretty significant move and maybe the world wants to hear me blab about it. But I think in general I have been blabbing about it, but in more specific channels. But that&#39;s not to say I shouldn&#39;t have a larger periodic update.</description>

      <title>Another adventure begins.  Goodbye Omaha.</title>

      <description>My time in Omaha is coming to an end. On Friday, February 3rd I&#39;ll have relocated to San Francisco. When looking back at the past three years it&#39;s hard to decide what to put in this rather long retrospective post. But I&#39;ll use it as my last opportunity to highlight, clarify, give thanks, and try to explain why I&#39;m taking on this new adventure.
I moved to Omaha thinking I&#39;d have to dodge cows on the way to the office every day.</description>
