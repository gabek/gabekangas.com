      <description>Seven days from today I&#39;ll be on my way to Omaha. A moving company is coming first thing Saturday morning to put everything on a truck and off I go. Sounds so simple.
In honor of me leaving, I put together a quick collection of some photos of random times/events/entertaining things that took place here. I have another week to make some more great memories, but here&#39;s a little selection so far.</description>

      <title>Anyone shop online for clothes?  Aparently it&#39;s more difficult than I thought.</title>

      <description>Seems like right now is the first time in a while i&#39;ve just been sitting around relaxing. Threw some laundry in, picked up a little. Probably get back to packing this weekend at some point.
A week from right now I&#39;ll already be in Omaha. Slightly surreal.
I&#39;m trying to go through online and bookmark new clothes, since I&#39;m having to go through an overhaul of my wardrobe. I can no longer wear concert tshirts and cartoon characters to work.</description>

      <description>So last weekend when I last blogged I met up with Katie, Tracy, Michelle and Frank. We had a blast! This Friday night we hope to go out and be all stupid again. In fact, a friend of Frank&#39;s (ex-girlfriend&#39;s sister actually) is from Omaha, and is in town. So she&#39;s going to go out with us. I have so many awesome resources for this move, I can&#39;t complain one bit.</description>

      <description>So I&#39;ve been back now since Tuesday night. I can say it&#39;s slightly odd being back. I had a nice going away lunch with my old team Wednesday, and went out last night after work with some of the Chicago people for dinner and drinks.
I&#39;m seeing more and more people moving on with their lives without me in it. Makes sense, and completely expected, but often hard to watch.</description>

      <description>Tonight I called my buddy Sean at Old Town Tatu to schedule my Illinois state tattoo. Tuesday night at 8pm. Not sure where it&#39;s going yet, or in what style... but he&#39;s an awesome artist, and i&#39;ll work with him on it. I just want to take Illinois with me when I go.I sent out a blast email (and myspace post) today to everyone letting them know of my time table.</description>

      <description>I dragged Cassie (well actually she drove most of the way) to Chicago this week. Been here since Tuesday night, and it&#39;s really nice to see the city again.
It is a little eye opening though. Living here for so long, then going elsewhere, and then coming back.
All the odd looks and questions when I say I really do like Omaha, and i&#39;m not just saying that to back myself up in the move.</description>

      <description>Yesterday it was announced that the office I used to work at in Chicago, and who many still work at will be closing at the end of October.I understand that business is business, but these are my friends. Friends that believed my company when they acquired it a couple years ago and said &#34;this office and everyone in it is going nowhere. We value the employees here and we&#39;re keeping this Chicago office.</description>

      <description>So today i&#39;m saying my goodbye&#39;s at the Chicago office. There&#39;s a get together after work today at a local pub and it seems like a decent amount of people are going to be showing up.Just got back a few ago from my last ROM coffee run. My secret crush, Lilly, wasn&#39;t there, though.
My desk is clean, things are packed up for me to bring home... another chapter closed in the big book of relocation.</description>

      <description>Friday morning started like any other Friday morning. By Friday afternoon I found out that Andy Peters and I were headed to Chicago that night to see one of the last performances of our favorite band, Nine Inch Nails.
A while back Skid Vis surprised Andy and I by telling us he hooked us up with tickets to the completely sold out Nine Inch Nails show in Chicago. However it was a &#34;</description>

      <title>Reflecting on my ten year High School reunion</title>

      <description>I didn&#39;t originally want to go. But to everyone who told me I should: Thank you.Everyone knows I didn&#39;t know what to expect. But now that the Grant Community High School class of 1999 reunion is over I can&#39;t help but look at those four years far different than I did before. I&#39;ll be honest and tell you that I really did discount that time. It wasn&#39;t awful, but I was glad it was behind me.</description>

      <description>Wow, ten years since I graduated high school. Many probably will say &#34;it seems like only yesterday&#34; but to me it seems much, much longer. In fact, to be honest, I hardly remember those four years at all. Sure some special moments stand out that included performances or things with friends, but on the whole... really, nothing.I wasn&#39;t planning on going to the reunion. It wasn&#39;t until my friend Becky from high school asked me to go did I cave and signed up and booked a flight.</description>
