Threw some laundry in, picked up a little. Probably get back to packing this weekend at some point.</p><p>A week from right now I'll already be in Omaha. Slightly surreal.</p><p>I'm trying to go through online and bookmark new clothes, since I'm having to go through an overhaul of my wardrobe. I can no longer wear concert tshirts and cartoon characters to work. No huge deal, everywhere else i've worked has been business casual too. It's just been a few years since I've been in that environment, and my stuff isn't anything I'm willing to wear anymore. Last weekend I bought a few new shirts, couple pairs of pants, and a new pair of shoes. And there's only more to go.</p><p>However, looking for new clothes online is something of a joke. I've never really used the internet for "real clothes" before, just tshirts and things I know what i'm looking for. If you go to Amazon under men's shirts you get get like "Viewing 1 - 24 of 29,000". How is that at all manageable? I don't know what I'm looking for, I just know I need new shirts. But there's got to be a better way. Seems Yahoo shopping at least can sort by colour, so that's a start.</p><p>Yesterday was my last day at West Notifications Group. I was told there was going to be some kind of going away thing at some point before I move. But for now I'm going back to my same seat Monday morning. Just working on a different team. I called my new manager Friday and asked what the plan wast for Monday. He didn't really have one yet, but that's understandable. It's not like he can just sit down with me and get me in the game. I'll probably just start logging into systems and getting used to things until I finally get to HQ on Thursday.</p><p>Last night I went out with Frank, Tracy, Katie and Frank's friend Rachel who's from Omaha. I came home early, though. It's been a long week and I was beat. But I have another Omaha contact now in case I have questions. You can't beat that.</p></body></html><hr></div><div class="hmdl-page-comments mdl-color-text--primary-contrast mdl-card__supporting-text comments">Gabe Kangas<p></p><span>Oct 4, 2008</span></div></div></div></main><footer class=mdl-mini-footer><div class=mdl-mini-footer--left-section><a class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-js-ripple-effect mdl-button--icon mdl-mini-footer--social-btn social-btn" href="mailto:gabek@real-ity.com?subject=Hi"><i class="material-icons_lg icon ion-email"></i><span class=visuallyhidden>Email</span></a>
