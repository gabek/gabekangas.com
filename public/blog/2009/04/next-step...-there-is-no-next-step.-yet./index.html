I've been thinking about that a lot lately.  What is my next step?  And I don't mean personally, or professionally.  But something of both.  It shouldn't really be that separate.  Thinking of yourself as two halfs is really a shame.  To think you have to live two lives that cannot intersect is limiting your potential.</p><p>But that's kind of where I am.  Personally, I'm confident I live in one of the best cities in the world, surrounded by some of the most talented, influential, and intelligent people I've ever met.  This is not an overstatement.  I have friends who make things, who write things, who organize things, who turn dreams into reality.  They make things happen, and they're damn good at it.  I am absolutely honored.</p><p>Professionally, I have an awesome job a ton of people would love to have.  Seriously.  I make things happen at a multi zillion dollar company.  I get paid well, I have good benefits.  I would completely look up to myself if I met myself while younger.</p><p>But there's a sense of synergy that is missing.  The sum of my parts equal exactly how the math says it should.  But damnit, I want more.</p><p>This is a common theme with me.  If you've known me any length of time I'm rarely satisfied.  I thought for the longest time it was just because it was simply that, I'd never be satisfied.  But after making major changes, I see major changes.  Who knew?</p><p>Professionally I'm kind of where I wanted to be.  So my vision and goals professionally aren't there.  What do you do when you're doing what you wanted to do?  Maybe I just never had lofty enough goals.  I never wanted to be president, or an astronaut.  I wanted to be a badass IT guy.  Sure, I learn more every day, and I will always continue to grow.  But again, I'm rarely satisfied.  I always need something to work towards.</p><p>I only start thinking about all this stuff when my two halfs start to actively start fighting each other.  It's one thing if 1+1=2, but it's another when 1+1 &lt; 2.  I've had more and more reactions at work that are similar to "Oh come on.  I didn't have any problem with this kind of stuff, but now you're just pissing me off."  And that sucks.  Little jab after little jab.  It bothers me only because I liked it when I was content.  But new management and increased scrutiny change how/when/where we perform our jobs.  But that's the corporate world . They squeeze and squeeze until some things slip out of their hand, but still have a much tighter grip on what is left.</p><p>Again, not complaining.  But sometimes things are enlightening.  I want 1+1 >= 3.</p><p>I'd love to have a conversation with those that can relate, or have have posed similar questions to themselves.</p></body></html><hr><h4>I have more stuff you can read if you like.
