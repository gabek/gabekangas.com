Now with Runscope Radar you can turn a request into an API test template to make sure that thing that was broke stays fixed.  Oh, and it pretty prints the JSON of each request.  Could you do all of this with in-house unit tests, a copy of Charles, and your clipboard?  Sure, but not this good.  It just works.  I wouldn't be overestimating if I said it has saved me days of work.  And the same can be probably said for my teammates who I send Runscope URLs to saying "Could you look at this?"</p><a href=http://runscope.com target=_blank><img

Runscope<h3><a target=_blank href=http://crashlytics.com>Crashlytics</a></h3><p>If you're like me you've tried a few crash reporting services.  Also if you're like me you've kind of been annoyed by all of them in some way or another.  Crashlytics wasn't really on my radar until I went to the Twitter mobile dev event a while back.  They gave a demo of Crashlytics and it caught my attention.  It works just like any other crash reporting service, but the difference is it runs a service in the background on your build machine.  This may bother some people, but it's nice that it's taking care of grabbing the dSYM and keeping track of archived builds without me taking extra steps.  Because of this I've also not had to spend a single second manually symbolicating crash logs that Crashlytics hasn't been able to handle or because I forgot to upload the dSYM.</p><p>Another nice benefit, It allows you to set arbitrary keys as your user progresses through the application, so I know of things like the last artist id a user viewed, or a chart they were checking out.  Oh, and it's free.</p><img src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_528c3740e4b0c1452600b050_1384920998734_tmxsandbox.PNG_ alt><h2>Product Development</h2><p>When I started at TastemakerX one of the first things we decided was that we'd be making a rather large change from the idea of the v1 product they had already built.  So we spent some time really knocking out what we wanted this product to be.  During this time I still wanted to be working on some useful code.  So I built some standalone sandbox apps to work out things like networking, image handling, Facebook Open Graph, playlist generation, etc as reusable classes I could seamlessly move over to a production app once we knew what the app would entail.</p><p>I know most projects don't have the luxury to start working on the application before they start working on the application, but it gave me a nice head start.  Not to mention it enforces solid design patterns when you're writing code not knowing how you'll be using it later.  There's no UI to contaminate your thinking.</p><p> </p><h2>Some things I've learned</h2><p>I would hope every project I ever work on I'd learn something new.  This is no exception.  Maybe some of these might jog something you might want to look at.</p><ul><li>Storyboards are fine.  Use them, or not.  I don't care.  This was my first non-sideproject storyboard from scratch application I've done and I made the mistake early on to try to *only* use the storyboard.  Know when it doesn't make sense, and go create your nib files.</li><li>Don't mix up objectWithID, objectRegisteredForID and existingObjectWithID.  Just saying.</li><li>You're probably not using NSSet/NSOrderedSet as much as you could be.</li><li>You're also probably not using NSCache as much as you could be.</li><li>Take advantage of iOS 7's <a target=_blank href=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:>performFetchWithCompletionHandler</a>.  You have a background window of time to do some work.  So instead of just fetching new data, maybe also do some of the post-processing you would normally have to do when the UI is up.  Maybe pre-calculate the height of UITableView cells for this data and cache that for later, or if you downloaded some images that need to be resized take care of some of that.  But there's only so much you can do in this window, so be smart about it.</li><li>Speaking of UITableView, check out iOS 7's <a target=_blank href=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UITableViewDelegate/tableView:estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath:>estmatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath</a> if it makes sense for you.  It'll postpone the height calculation for a row until it's rendered instead of upfront.  This makes more sense on older devices, but on the flipside you might see some frames drop the first time the actual <a target=_blank href=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UITableViewDelegate/tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath:>heightForRowAtIndexPath</a> is called to calculate the real height when the row is being built.</li><li>Aside from the audio playback manager, almost every instance of KVO I originally implemented eventually got ripped out.  What seems like an elegant solution using KVO is probably just making things over complex.  Think about if that's really the solution for the problem.</li><li>I have all network calls go through a singleton and fire off completion blocks.  That's worked really well and in retrospect I wish I did the same thing with Core Data.  On the same topic, if I were to go back (and might!) I would never pass back managed objects.  Use Core Data for storage, and build standalone, separate objects out of them.  Each object can have a reference to its Core Data counterpart for CRUD operations.</li></ul><p>So that's my little rundown on things I found useful or interesting so far with TastemakerX.  I'd love to hear things that you're using to make your life easier or things you wish you would have known when you started as well.  Have fun, mobile friends!</p><img src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_52a22368e4b0866eaca12521_1386357614787_tmxs.png_ alt=Iterate!> Iterate!</body></html><hr><h4>I have more stuff you can read if you like.
