<p>So it's Monday.  For whatever reason my alarm didn't go off, but I never sleep late anymore so I woke up without a problem anyway.  Just woke up a little later than I wanted to.  No biggy.
Had a good weekend.  Sat around and watched Joost last night.  It's a great alternative to paying the awful cable company $100 month for Oxygen Network and the Golf Channel.</p>
<p>I'm not allowed to talk about certain people on my blog, but that doesn't mean I can't tell you what's going on in my life.  My second attorney filed a continuance last Wednesday to push off the court date due to the injunction that's still on the record.  I was told that opposing counsel and my attorney couldn't come to an agreement on that injunction and gag order, so they'll have to fight it out in front of a judge later on.  Hence the continuance.  I'll fight this injunction forever if I have to.  This divorce will not be finalized until it's gone.  I hired a specialist attorney who deals with online privacy issues just to fight it, and i'll do more if needed.  Take my life away from me, fine.  But you can't take my freedom of speech online.  So yeah, I was supposed to be divorced by now.  But it doesn't matter to me.  I want to do it right, not do it fast.  I do hope that this resolved quickly for everyone's sake, however.</p>
<p>You may wonder why I'm even in this mess to begin with.  The best I can guess is there might be a claim of "Publication of Private Facts".  Even though nothing I've done has fallen into that, and that's not even what i'm hearing the problem is.  Everything i've ever published is in the public domain, as there was the telling of at least one other person, and therefore making it public.   But again, that's not what the complaint is.  I'm just trying to make sense out of nonsense.</p>
<p>And remember, everyone feel free to comment without fear of anyone going after me for something you said on my blog.  Section 230 of Title 47 of the United States Legal Code protects my rights in that.</p>
