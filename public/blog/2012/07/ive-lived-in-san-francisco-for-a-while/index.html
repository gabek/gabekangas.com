I mean, there must be a lot of stuff to talk about, right? It's a pretty significant move and maybe the world wants to hear me blab about it. But I think in general I have been blabbing about it, but in more specific channels.  But that's not to say I shouldn't have a larger periodic update.  And I'd probably miss a ton, so I'm going to do the generalizing thing instead of trying to think of every neat thing specifically.  Ok, I'll throw some specifics in too.
San Francisco is like a custom-made little city that was built just for me.  The fact that I'm sure a lot of people feel that way speaks to the variety and life that this little big city brings.  I remember the first time I went to the Cat Club and the DJ played Prodigy's "Spitfire".  I looked to my friend and said "I don't remember the last time I heard The Prodigy played publicly."  It's one of those tiny moments that bring things into perspective and made me glad I was here.</p><p>Obviously I love music, and this city is great for the music that I enjoy.  Just like Omaha is a great city for people who enjoy acoustic guitars and singer-songwriters, San Francisco is great for people who enjoy synthesizers, and electronic drums.  Other things too.  I just happen to like things I can dance to.  I can go out multiple times a week and dance all night to VNV Nation, Apoptygma Berzerk, and Nine Inch Nails from a DJ; surrounded by other people who enjoy it as much as I do.  It's a city where all the artists that I enjoy come through, and I really have to pay attention to the concert calendar so I don't miss something.  There's so much.</p><p>One time at pride after getting backstage at a DJ VIP area I danced on stage in front of all of these people (below). <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a063/1355981319678/?format=original"><img title=pride height=225 alt width=300 class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-36822" src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a066_1355981319691__></a></p><p>The people here are an interesting breed.  In general they're all young, all good looking, and all full of energy.  They don't get married young, and they don't have children.  My kind of people.  It's easier to meet friends because there are just more people able to go out without finding baby sitters.  There's an overarching trend of people being "outdoorsy" here.  Like hiking, or camping, or white water rafting or whatever.  This puzzled me when I first moved here.  How is everyone doing this crap?  I don't even walk on a single blade of grass in a day (100% true), so where are they setting up a tent?  It doesn't snow, where are they skiing?  But it seems that SF is close enough to all of these places.  And while I do believe people do enjoy it, I think people make a bigger deal out of it just to fit in, since everybody else climbs mountains, there's pressure for you to enjoy that too.  FYI: I don't climb mountains.  But outside of the people who obviously try and fit in, people here are awesome.  They're crazy.  They lack in inhibitions.  They do what makes them happy.  It took me zero time to feel at home here.  These are my people.</p><p>One time Andy Peters (@andypeters) came for WWDC and I dragged him to Bondage-a-go-go, my weekly dance club night.  It was totally rad to be able to bring one of my good Omaha friends out with me in San Francisco.  He had a blast.</p><p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a069/1355981319703/?format=original"><img title="Gabe and Andy" height=300 alt width=225 class="size-medium wp-image-36823 aligncenter" src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a06c_1355981319715__></a></p><p>I expected when I came here to throw myself head-first into the startup culture.  I mean, this is the center of the technology world.  But that hasn't been the case.  I think it's simply because I'm enjoying myself at my current position and I'm not looking to throw myself into something else right now.  I'm making video games, and it's brand new to me.  Something new is always a ton more fun, so I'm enjoying it immensely.  My company is great, and I enjoy everybody who works there.  I tell people it's like going to summer camp every day.  You work on projects together with peers, but in this case we make money off of our projects, and still have fun.  Though I know myself well enough that somewhere down the road I will be looking for "what's next?", and I couldn't be in a better place to find out.  But I know I need to get out there and start meeting people to make that happen.  It's just hard when you work late nights in Burlingame, ya' know?</p><p>Speaking of work, one time I launched a video game with an awesome team called <a title="Fish With Attitude" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fish-with-attitude/id509854030?mt=8">Fish With Attitude</a>.  It's a pretty fun game, if I do say so myself.  It's being rated very highly, it's ranked in the Top 10 of the Apple App Store, and the players love it.  In fact, we received a marriage proposal from someone who enjoyed the game so much the other day.  Crazy.  Here's everyone that's ever been involved with it at a bar.  And a random review someone did of it.</p><p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a06f/1355981319729/?format=original"><img title="Team Fish with Attitude" height=223 alt width=300 class="size-medium wp-image-36825 aligncenter" src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a072_1355981319742__></a></p><p>Did you know there's a place where you can order almost any kind of food, completely online, at almost any hour of the day?  That place is San Francisco, and they realize sometimes you just need a calzone at 3am.  Seriously, you don't even have to call them.  Order from your iPhone if you want!  This fact cannot be overstated.</p><p>So that's that for now.  Rock on.</p><p><iframe src="http://blip.tv/play/gaZogvymBwI.html?p=1" width=780 height=438 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><embed type=application/x-shockwave-flash src=http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#gaZogvymBwI style=display:none></embed></p></body></html><hr><h4>I have more stuff you can read if you like.
