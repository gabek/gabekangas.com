Rasputina last night
Jul 9, 2007




Saw Rasputina at The Abby last night.  Was a good show.  The set list was better the first time I saw them, but we had a good time anyway.  They rocked out and everyone enjoyed it.  I'm tired today, though.  Out late, up early, and i'll be out late tonight too because of work.
Next stop, The Pitchfork Music Festival to see The New Pornographers and Of Montreal this Sunday.
