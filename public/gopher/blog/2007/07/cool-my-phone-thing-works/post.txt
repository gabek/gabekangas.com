Cool my phone thing works
Jul 29, 2007


So I spent yesterday playing more with Asterisk PBX and I have a pretty neat system working.  I could add all kinds of features now.  So far I have voicemails being emailed to me working, custom menus, call forwarding to my fax line, cell phone and any other numbers.  If it's a certain date/time/whatever I can make it go right to voicemail and not ring any phones, or just go right to a different line.  I need to figure out TTS stuff still, not sure why that seems to be broke.
