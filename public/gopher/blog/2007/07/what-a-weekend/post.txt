What a weekend
Jul 16, 2007



I should go to bed, but I thought i'd post quick.  It was an awesome weekend.  Photos are up from Lauren, Mary and I going to Kinetic Playground Saturday night.  And Mary and I went to The PItchfork Music Festival today.
Now I have to try and pretend to be normal again and go back to work in the morning :P
