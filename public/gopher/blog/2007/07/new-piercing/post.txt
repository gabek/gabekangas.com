New piercing
Jul 2, 2007



Left lobe.  10 gauge.

Lauren thought I was crazy for getting that big of a piercing right off the bat.  But there's nothing as invigorating as a big needle ripping through flesh to feel alive.  I guess it could also make you feel like you're dying.  But whatever.  I think it's cool.
