Staying home
Sep 17, 2007



I sent an email that i'm not going into work Monday. I'm just feeling too lousy. If i'm not feeling better i'll go to the local clinic and get some drugs to fight this off. It seems like I was just sick, but here I am again feeling the same. Oh well.
Because i've slept so much this weekend it's after midnight now and i'm not really all that tired. I guess i'll read for a bit.
