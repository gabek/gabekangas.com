One of those days
Sep 11, 2007



Today is one of those days that I just want to blow my fucking brains out. I haven't had many of those days in the recent past. Maybe it's because i've been out of my antidepz and my fucking doctor won't let me have a refill.
Seriously I don't know what the hell is going on. I realize i'm completely shitty at making friends and keeping them and I don't know why. I trust that things are fine and then boom. I get yelled at for something, or they just disappear or whatever. This would be completely understandable if it wasn't for the fact that I think i'm a pretty cool person to hang out with now. I wasn't before, but this is now. And now still seems to suck ass.
I'm sick of my job. I'm sick of my money problems. I'm sick of being the divorced loser while everyone else in the world is having the time of their lives. Fuck that.
Someone put me out of my misery.
