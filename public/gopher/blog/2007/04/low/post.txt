Low
Apr 6, 2007



Low ain't low.  It can go, lower than you know.Look inside and it won't show, what happened long ago.
Optimists are just a lie.
An option is to die.
On my cross I'm crucified.
Do you know where to go?
Then why don't you show if you know?
Do you know how to get there?
Do you know where to go?

"Low" as heard on 2002's "/me" album.  Click to hear.
Fuck me and my self prophesizing lyrics.
The lyrics I wrote for my new album are crazy messed up.  I wrote them having no idea my wife was going to divorce me.  But the songs somehow knew.  I swear they did.
