headache clinic?
Feb 3, 2007


To go or not to go?  There's a place in chicago called the Diamond Headache Clinic.  Being i've been on another bad downswing with the whole migraine thing i'm thinking I should see someone else... again.  Not that I haven't seen enough people in the past, but it hasn't helped all that much.  One thing I have got out of my neurologist is the wonderful drug of Relpax.  You take one when you feel it coming on, and it takes about 2hrs to kick in.  But it works almost all of the time, it really is a life saver.  Previously i'd have to stay home instead of going somewhere, now I have something that can help.  The problem is I don't have a way to prevent them from coming on, and I can only get 6 pills of Relpax at a time for insurance reasons.  I do take a pill every night, but it doesn't really seem to do anything.
I'll think about it.
