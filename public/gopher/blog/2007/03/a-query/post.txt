A query

If you take the peripherals and case away from a computer, is it the same computer?
If you take the sleek outside face away from a mac, is it then just a PC?  What's inside?  Can it be rebuilt as something new?  Or should it just get trashed?  It's far from operational without any kind of interface.
What do the insides really mean?
