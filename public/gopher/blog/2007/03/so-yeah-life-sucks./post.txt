So yeah, life sucks.
Mar 20, 2007



Kelley got in an accident the other day, the van is wrecked, but she's ok.  So we're on one car.  It sucks having to try and sync our schedules so I can be picked up, but we're doing our best.
Kelley's dad is in the hospital.  Heart and respiratory failure or something.  He was knocked out pretty good last night.
And things continue to go downhill.
