Wild dream last night
Nov 1, 2007



So I had a dream last night. Really odd one.
I dreamt that I had some control over a robot. Like a big, crazy, Voltronesque robot. But nobody knew about it, even though it was huge. And I controlled it via a unix shell.
There was someone, and i'm not sure who.. or why, but I wanted them dead. And I found out they were flying on a plane. So I told my robot to grab the plane (with it's hands. yes, the robot is that big), and throw the plane into space. Everyone on the plane died. Then I turned myself into the police.
The police were happy to see me turn myself in for the death of the one person I admitted to, but I never admitted to the rest of the people who died on the plane, nor would I explain that I had a robot, or how I did it.
It was at this point in the story I realized I had something I needed to finish at work. So the cops drove me to work and sat by my desk as I finished up a few things before they escorted me directly to prison. No trial, no courts. Directly to jail.
And in my cell is where my dream ended.
Crazy, eh?
