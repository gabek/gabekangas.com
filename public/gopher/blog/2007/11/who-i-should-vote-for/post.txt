Who I should vote for
Nov 16, 2007



So I listened to Net@Nite the other day and heard about a new site called Connect2Elect.  It allows you to rate what is important to you as far as views, and it'll rank what candidates match you.
You put all your views, in order of importance, and this is what I ended up with.


Now it may be a bit misleading, as some of the things I ranked as #1 in importance aren't "core issues" of the election.  So to vote purely on an issue that is much less important globally, but something I feel strongly for is probably a mistake.  Regardless I urge each of you to check out the site and see what comes up.
