Hello from Marquette, Michigan
Oct 27, 2007



I made it up to the UP in one piece. My car didn't disappear or anything. I have about 30min or so until I have to be at my aunt's for my grandparent's 60th anniversary party. But I decided to drive around and see if I could find somewhere with wifi.
I found a Starbucks and knew that would be a good start.
I walk in, "Excuse me, do you have wifi?" they respond "Yes we do. Well, we don't, but someone else around here does. And the signal reaches in here."
Good enough for me.
So I know where to go if I have time later to get back online. I miss the internet. My treo desn't even work up here :(
Ok, talk to everyone later
