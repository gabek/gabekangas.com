The Peanut Butter Solution
Oct 7, 2007




Where to begin. I remember watching this movie as a kid. And by "remember" I remember vaguely very little about the movie other then how I felt about the movie. For years I thought I made up the movie. I didn't really remember the plot. All I remembered was a terrifying movie that troubled me deeply as a child and always stayed with me as I got older. For a while I figured it was a dream I had as a kid and that's why I don't really remember it, but just know it was messed up, as many dreams are.
After some time on Google, a while ago I figured i'd give it a shot and do some queries. Something about peanut butter, and hair, and a movie. And eventually I came to my answer. This troubling item of my past was real. And it's called The Peanut Butter Solution.
You think i'm crazy, don't you? I'm not. Look at these quotes from the YouTube page with it's trailer. "This movie used to creep me out when I was only 4 or 5. I'm 23 now and just watching the trailer brings back horrible memories!", "I was like 4 years old when I used to watch this movie..I used to be shit scared back then..I never got over it, been looking for it for years", "The trailer makes it sound like such a light-hearted, non-nightmare-causing film...But we know better.", "yea this movie destroyed me whe i was a primary school! ahhhhh! so cool people still remember it! it must have realy scared our inocent minds!"... and on and on and on. I'm not the only one.
By comparison check out the Canadian trailer of the exact same movie.
I mentioned the movie to Steph in #TheCabin asking if she's seen it. She's uber-canadian so I figured if anyone has, she would. And she did. And she freaked. "<^_^bean> i have had nightmares of that movie since I first saw it in third grade".
I somehow feel better about it all after reading what others have had to say, and talking to Steph about it. It's closure. Or as close as possible, anyway. It'll never leave any of us.
