That's cool in itself, but the article name: The Web's Most Useful Sites.
Really?  Sweet!  I'll take it!
Now I need to go out and get a print copy of the magazine, cuz that's so very cool.
Here's a PDF of the web version.

Edit: Jeff just got his copy of February's PC World and it's in there.  Go out and get yourself a copy!
