An update

I'm not allowed to post things to my blog anymore.  I'm not sure if i'm allowed to say that, but my friends and family deserve a quick post.
I can't tell you why, because i'm not allowed to tell you.
I can't tell you when i'll be able to again, i'm sorry.  I thought password protecting the posts from the public would be over and above what i'd be expected to do, but nothing is good enough.  I'll have to remove all the posts so nobody can see them again, it's not my choice, but it's what I have to do.
None of this is really fair, and I don't really know what to say or do about it.  I'm being attacked from all sides and I haven't done anything wrong.
