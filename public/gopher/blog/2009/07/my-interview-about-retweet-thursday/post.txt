My interview about Retweet Thursday
Jul 16, 2009



Well who would have thought?  The fine people over at Silicon Prairie News were interested in talking to me about the weirdest meme to ever hit Twitter (aside from #MufasaMonday I suppose), #retweet_thursday.
They told me they weren't sure who was behind it at first, but figured out it was out of Omaha somewhere, so they pinpointed it to me.  I never really made it public that the bot was run by me, but I wasn't really hiding the fact either :)
They came to me asking if I'd be willing to tell my story about why it came about, what the deal with the @RT_Thursday account was, and how it all worked.
So take a stop over and check out the article and video interview:
Retweet This: @GabeK Behind @RT_Thursday
And while you're there check out all of the other awesome posts about what's going on in the Omaha area.  There's a great interview with Rahul Gupta that you won't want to miss.
