Barcamp Omaha 2010 was rad (and the jam was fun)
Nov 22, 2010



Thanks to the organization team of Barcamp2010 here in Omaha it was another great event.  Learned some stuff and had some fun.
Also thanks to everyone to indulged me in my attempt for a lunchtime jam session.  I can't honestly say it was the most musical thing ever performed, but we all had fun anyway :)  Thanks to everyone who took part!  It was nice to mix things up a bit.
