7 days to go/Photo montage
Oct 25, 2008



Seven days from today I'll be on my way to Omaha. A moving company is coming first thing Saturday morning to put everything on a truck and off I go. Sounds so simple.
In honor of me leaving, I put together a quick collection of some photos of random times/events/entertaining things that took place here. I have another week to make some more great memories, but here's a little selection so far.
So here's some awesome photos. Enjoy.
