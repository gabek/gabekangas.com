Hello Omaha part 2
Sep 20, 2008



So it's official. October will be the last month I live in the fine state of Illinois.
Who would have ever thought, right? But yesterday I accepted the position in Omaha, NE with West.
My first day in my new role will be October 6th, so I gave West Notifications my 2 weeks yesterday. After that they're going to fly me out a couple times so I can find somewhere to live, meet my team, and get my move situated. It looks like they're really going to take care of me, even paying to break my lease in my apartment.
So I guess there's not much to say right now other than it's going to happen.
