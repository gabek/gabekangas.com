Hello this is Gabe blogging from the car using jott.com.  I am just speaking into my phone and hopefully jott is transcribing what I am saying properly.  I just ____ to send a twitter a few minutes ago ____ somebody's name which makes me look really stupid, that's okay, so yeah I am  going to meet this person that jott does know the name of ____ my guess is that probably do something after that because the night is young and it is a Friday night. listen
