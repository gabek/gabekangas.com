I threw up at Cloverfield
Jan 28, 2008



Just a quick update to tell everyone that I threw up at Cloverfield last night.
It was the second time of me seeing it. I had a full meal (with desert) at Steak and Shake just moments before going to the theater. I hadn't felt all that great all day, a little dizzy and such.
I figure about 40min into the movie and it was time to go. Threw up in a garbage can right in the hallway.
I'm oddly proud of this feat.
Cloverfield rocks!!!!
