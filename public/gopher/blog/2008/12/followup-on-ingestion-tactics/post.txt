Followup on ingestion tactics
Dec 11, 2008



Today is Thursday.  The 4th full day without any meat.  I'm sure it's by far the longest stretch of doing so in my whole life.  *maybe* i've gone a whole day without eating meat once.. maybe.
But four days is nothing.  But I felt it was worth updating anyway.
The first couple days I didn't think anything of it.  Just started eating different foods.  Yesterday, day three, it hit me.  I wanted meat.  Maybe it's all mental, but I also wasn't feeling that well.  Not sick, but weak.  I talked to Kat and she asked what it is I have been eating.  Apparently the technique of replacing meat with tomatoes isn't going to work and explains my slight fatigue.  I currently have no protein in my diet and haven't had any for days.  I feel a little worse than I did yesterday, and I got a good night sleep and everything so I can only attribute it to that.  So it looks like I need to remedy this situation.
To go along with whatever it was I started feeling yesterday I also had my first meat craving.  Argh.  I wanted taco bell, I wanted wendys, I wanted everything.  It hit out of nowhere.  But I won't cave.  Oh no.  My guess the craving is because my body is pissed and requires something I refuse to put in it.  Anyone who said "I felt better the first week after removing meat from my diet" is lying.  They're a pretencious bastard who will try to make you feel bad for eating delicious murdered animals.  Don't listen to them.  mmmmm... murder.
Went to dinner with Kat last night to Noodles & Company.  Awesome.  I think i'll eat there a lot.  Most everything is without meat, but you add whatever meat you want to it.  I had a delicious thing that I didn't even know what it was and I didn't even miss the meat.
My fear is by the time I think I'm done with the experiment and I should eat meat again... I won't want to.  Oh god, what am I doing?
