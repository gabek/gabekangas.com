      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I got email really working.  It wasn't working before.  In fact most emails were bouncing.  So if you emailed me, and it bounced... please send again.
Got my web log back up, obviously.  Tonight i'll have to reinstall the photo album database.  I just realized I have the old version installed that wasn't database driven.  Wonder if I can import it.  Still a ton lost, but maybe it's something?</p>
<p>But yeah, email me again if needed.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How time flies!  It's been over a year since my 2005 wrapup post, and things have <strong>really</strong> changed! I hope you'll follow me through another journey that is my yearly post. I like to think the things I use are pretty good, and that I go through the crap so you don't have to. Here's the one time of year I can tell you not just what I recommend, but what I really use/do/listen to/etc.
Step 1.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/?p=120">Read last year's post.</a></p>
<p>Step 2.  Read this one...<!--more--></p>

<p>I'll have to split this into different parts.  I could do it by "Home" and "Work".  But i'd rather do it by "Windows", "Mac" and "Other".  Here we go.</p>

<blockquote><p>It's a general purpose blogging client that has a Windows and Mac version.  I've liked that it has both versions, so i've used it as my full time tool.  I'm using it right now, obviously.  It's not life changing, or anything.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox / Thunderbird</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Again, no reason to use anything but these two on windows.  Both have been updated this year with new features.  The best mail client and web browser ever.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/">Filezilla</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A great free FTP client.  I use it a ton at work.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.feeddemon.com/">Feeddemon</a></p>
<blockquote><p>So i've been using feeddemon as my full time RSS client most of the year.  Mostly because it was purchased by Newsgator, and Newsgator has sync functionality, and I love the idea of syncing my read/unread status between home and work.  Otherwise you are rereading things you read already, and i'm overloaded with news as it is.  I still miss RSSBandit sometimes, but Feeddemon, even though it's a commercial product, is pretty good.  I wish it had combined folder viewing though.  It pisses me off that it doesn't.  But I deal.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.putty.nl/download.html">PuTTY</a> (PieTTY)</p>
<blockquote><p>I still use PuTTY every day.  There's some offshoots I ran into, like PieTTY that adds features to the regular PuTTY, like transparancy.  So I use that.  But really, it's regular old PuTTY.  The best Windows SSH client around.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.stardock.com/products/objectdock/">ObjectDock</a></p>
<blockquote><p>At one point I decided I wanted my work PC to act and look like a mac.  I wasn't sure what I was thinking at the time.  However, after doing it, I realized that the way macs do things really <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> the best way after all.  This way is the dock.  And with ObjectDock you too can have the dock on your pc.  I rarely have to touch the start menu anymore.  And I never use the task bar.  Everything is in my dock, and I do love it.  Check how it looks on some of my <a target="_blank" href="http://photos.real-ity.com/album/gabe/screenshots/">screenshots</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">Gaim</a></p>
<blockquote><p>My IM client of choice.  It lets me combine all of my IM accounts into one nice package.  It talks Jabber, so even Google Talk works.  Score.  They've done a great job on the windows port.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cakewalk.com/sonar/">Cakewalk Sonar</a></p>
<blockquote><p>My DAW software of choice when having to use a PC, anyway.  I've been using it full time since working on the new album, and it's pretty good.  I no longer have to use Acid for anything, when previously I used Acid for <strong>everything</strong>.  But like all PC Audio software, there's just too much hardware crap you have to deal with.  Buffers, streams, drivers, etc, etc.  I spend a lot of time trying to make it work better instead of just working with it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.propellerheads.se/">Propellerhead Reason</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I love this software.  It's the best virutal analog environment ever.  You open it up, and you go to work.  I use it as the sketchboard for any new songs i'm working on, and use it full time for creating beats and drum loops.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Mac OS X Software</strong>
A list that less people will care about, probably.  But probably more important to me this year.
<a target="_blank" href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The most flexible, efficient, and fast editor ever.  All code I write is written in this.  (or <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a>.  I love vi).</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium X</a></p>
<blockquote><p>My IM client of choice.  Allows me to combine all the accounts into one nice client.  It's like Gaim, or Trillian, but it looks nicer and it's all mac-y.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit FTP</a></p>
<blockquote><p>This app rocks.  Edit things on the fly, sync folders, QuickSilver integration (you don't need to open up the app to actually connect to something.. sweet).</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the best things to ever happen to me.  Allows you to create triggers, usually via key combos, to do anything.  At the easiest, it will launch an app.  But it can do so much more.  Send an email, zip a file, connect to a ftp server, dial a phone number via Vonage, append to a list, play a mp3.  Anything you think of you can probably do with just a few keystrokes with QuickSilver.  It's not just a launcher, it's a new lifestyle.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Like Feeddemon, purchased by Newsgator this year.  It allows me to sync my newsreading elsewhere through that service.  I like it more than feeddemon since it allows combined folder views.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I don't do much web design stuff per se, but this tool was pretty important when putting together PandoraFM v3.  It became less important once I started using TextMate, though.  The CSS functionality in Dreamweaver is still what I use it for.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Other Software</strong>
And stuff that doesn't fit in the other two categories.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.chatteremail.com/">Chattermail</a></p>
<blockquote><p>This email client for PalmOS rocks.  It's a realtime IMAP IDLE compatible client, so when an email shows up in your INBOX you know, right then and there.  I love IMAP for email, and I love Chattermail to read it.  I don't remember life before mobile email on my Treo.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.smittyware.com/palm/upirc/">upIRC</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The IRC client I use on my Treo.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I'm not a blogger, really.  Bloggers are in their own category where people want to read what someone says because they're interesting.  But I do, however, use Wordpress for a different use.  If you go to www.real-ity.com, that's not wordpress.  That's a RSS aggrigator I wrote that slurps in all the RSS from everything in my digital life, and puts it all in one page for you to view.  That includes my online journal, published via Wordpress.  But Wordpress doesn't actually power that page.  /blog/, then, is Wordpress.  I've never really explained how my site worked, and now I have.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.irssi.org/">irssi</a></p>
<blockquote><p>New to #TheCabin this year, ekpneo, reccomended the IRC client irssi.  I was hesitant at first, as i've been using BitchX for so many years.  I gave it a shot, and while not totally impressed at first, the built in proxy is quite useful.  I never liked running a proxy itself, but now with the built in one I proxy through irssi with upIRC and XChat.  Three different IRCing environments, three different clients.  One connection.  One nick.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple Mac</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Need I say more?  Since having a mac i've been more productive, more creative, more efficient.  More a lot of things.  A great piece of hardware, an awesome operating system, and the software available by developers are top notch.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" title="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html" href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-admin/">Apple iPod</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Another year with my 4G iPod Photo going strong.  I'm not sure this one will last through this next year though.  I use it every day and won't leave home without it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.event1.com/Products/Digital/EZbus.html">Event EZBus</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Again it's the center of my digital audio world when doing recording.  Spent more time recording this past year than I have in quite a few years.  This piece of equipment helps make it possible.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.novationmusic.com/product.asp?id=16&Type=1&bArchive=False">Novation K-Station</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I've had this synth for a full year now, and I use it all the time.  It's been one of the best additions to my music setup ever, and I don't know how I ever lived without an external keyboard synth previously.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Podcasts
</strong>I listen to less podcasts now.  It's a good thing.  I've fired a lot of them.  Shows I no longer listen to: Adam Curry's Daily Source Code, The Dawn and Drew Show, Chris Porillo Show.  Here's the ones I do listen to.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.twit.tv">TWiT</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.twit.tv">The Daily Giz Wiz</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.twit.tv">Net@Nite</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.twit.tv">MacBreak Weekly (audio) / MacBreak (video)
</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11455_7-6457370-1.html">BuzzCast (or Buzz Out Loud)
</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.43folders.com">43 Folders</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget Podcast</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.maccast.com/">MacCast</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.diggnation.com">Diggnation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see a big chunk of them are Leo LaPorte run <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twit.tv">TWiT Network podcasts</a>.  They do good stuff, and that's why I keep listening to the shows.</p>
<p><strong>Services
</strong>These are the things run by others that I enjoy and relied on through the year.  Some are paid services, some are not.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a></p>
<blockquote><p>My favorite online radio site.  Run by smart people who know music.  I had the unique opportunity to work with a few different people from there this year, and it was a great experience with helpful people each time.  I paid a yearly fee to support the service (and it removes ads).</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.last.fm">Last.FM
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The only useful social networking site.  Seriously.  If I want to network with people, I want a reason to do it.  And the reason here is to find new music that other people like, and that you might like too.  It also has a great custom online radio station, but I tend to go to Pandora instead for that.  I donated in order to get the customized radio.  I pretty much had to if I was going to develop for it ;)</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://pandorafm.real-ity.com">PandoraFM</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I wrote this in order to merge the worlds of Pandora and Last.FM.  Listen to your Pandora, and have it show up on your Last.FM profile.  I've added lots of other features as well.  Tagging being the big one.  Without PandoraFM I wouldn't listen to Pandora at all, to be honest.  No matter how good it is.  I'll write a post maybe before the end of the year wrapping up the current and future of PandoraFM, along with a list of all the places and people where it was mentioned this past year.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsgator.com">Newsgator
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I only use this because i'm an RSS addict.  I suffer from information overload on a daily basis.  This service doesn't help me at all, but it makes it easier to deal with.  Things I read at work will no longer show up at home, and vice versa.  It also has a small mobile page so I can read things while in transit and mark those as read.  It just lets me be more officiant about my overload.  I paid for the year for the complete service, I forget how much it was, though.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mp3tunes.com">Mp3Tunes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A good, cheap backup service for your mp3 collection.  With a coupon it's $20 per year to store unlimited mp3s.  You can then stream them down using mp3tunes.com custom interface.  It's handy if you get online from random places and would like to listen to your tunes regardless of where you are.  I really only use it as a backup, though.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.allofmp3.com">AllofMp3</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Where I purchase all of my music from online.  Dirt cheap, illegal and high quality.  I mean legal.  So totally legal.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Allows me to bookmark at work, view them at home.  With RSS it lets me pop that stuff up on my web site as well.  Can send bookmarks with friends.  Good stuff, simple to use.  I like.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pollstar.com">Pollstar</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Sends me automated alerts when the concert tour schedule changes on any of my 99 artists I have listed.  Pitchfork is how I find out that Nine Inch Nails is going on tour, but Pollstar is who tells me that they'll be here next month and where/when the show is.  I pay an annual fee for the 99 band limit.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe i'm a rare one that makes distinguishing differences between "web sites" and "web services".  YouTube is a service.  They host videos.  And some of those videos are good.  With YouTube, any second of the day, you can view <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dmVU08zVpA">Dick in a Box</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-65uWKz26pM">extended live dance mix of Ice Ice Baby</a>.  That's a special thing.  I'm using YouTube to host "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=realgk">Gabe's Album Journal</a>" video series.  I hope in the next year to use YouTube more and to create more content in the video realm.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Web sites and News Feeds</strong>
Web pages and RSS feeds go hand in hand.  I have over 120 different sources for information on any number of topics.  I rarely ever actually go to the web sites listed, so just keep in mind the actual look and feel of the pages don't matter.  The content comes to me via syndication.  Here are my favorites.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com">Engadget</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The best place for gadget news.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.43folders.com">43 Folders</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I don't always follow it, but it is the best site about productivity online.  Just as good as the advice it gives is the amount of awesome Mac OSX tips and software that is discussed.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.aintitcool.com/">Ain't It Cool News</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Where I learn about all the new movies and behind the scenes stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a></p>
<blockquote><p>It's gotten better this year.  I only subscribe to the areas of the site that I want to ready about.  That allows me to filter out what I don't want (sports, games, etc)</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Tech news from the UK.  The RSS feed sucks, so it kind of bothers me, and I might unsubscribe because of that.  But the content is good when the content is good.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a></p>
<blockquote><p>For World News, Entertainment News</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.superherohype.com/">Super Hero Hype</a></p>
<blockquote><p>More movie news, about super hero movies.  It's the place to be when the new Spiderman plot leak comes out, or the new Batman movie begins filming.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/">Pitchfork Media</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Music news.  If it's breaking news about artists that i'm interested in, Pitchfork has it.  When The New Pornographers come out with a new album, Out Hud breaks up, or !!! books Chicago gigs, this is how I find out first.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And That's That!</strong></p>
<p>Hope you got through my post alright.  I don't write much on my site, and this is my one yearly post I hope everyone reads.  It's for your own good.</p>
<p>Enjoy your holidays everyone, and check out some of the stuff linked to above.</p>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How time flies! It's been over a year since my 2005 wrapup post, and things have really changed! I hope you'll follow me through another journey that is my yearly post. I like to think the things I use are pretty good, and that I go through the crap so you don't have to. Here's the one time of year I can tell you not just what I recommend, but what I really use/do/listen to/etc.Step 1. Read last year's post.
Step 2. Read this one...</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Happy Days Off</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/12/happy-days-off</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, they're days off for me, anyway.
I've been off so far this week, and this is my last day off.  Wanted to blow some vacation days before I lose them.  Wish I could carry some over, but I can't.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Been spending most of the time on music.  Most of it really sucks, so I find myself wanting to spend more and more time making it not suck.  I'm generally unsuccessful.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of things going on in a handful of songs, so I think i'm getting somewhere.</p>
<p>Beck said before releasing his most recent album that new releases from artists should combine not only the audio of a new CD, but videos, mashups, remixes, and the ability to customize the experience to the user.  I agree with all of that.  Even though I don't think DJ Tiesto will be knocking on my door anytime soon to do a remix to any of my tracks, there are communities online that enjoy remixing other people's work.  I'll see if I can get involved.  Plus I hope to have some music videos ready when the music is done.  I'd love to have other people involved in that too, but it takes a lot of time.</p>
<p>New YouTube video of my antics behind the mixer went up last night.  Enjoy.</p>
<p>So that's that.  Back to work!</p>]]></content:encoded>

</a>
Starting a program for music production.  Starting my first class January 8th.  It's not real college, no college credits, nothing more than me wanting to learn things.  So don't start thinking that i'm into the whole school thing, i'm not.  But if you want to learn things, like I do, then that's cool.  I see this as the complete opposite from "I take classes because I should."</p>

      <title>Over 1,000,000 tracks played through PandoraFM</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/12/over-1000000-tracks-played-through-pandorafm</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 1st of this year I started a counter on how many songs are being played through the PandoraFM interface.  I haven't really been paying attention to it lately, in any aspect.  I just let it run.  I haven't been changing, fixing.. doing anything to it.  I'm actually quite proud of that, it's running well for a ton of people and i'm not having to make daily fixes.  I guess all that time I spent on version 3 paid off in the end.
Anyway, I checked out the "Social" tab today, and saw:</p>
<p><em>Over 1,052,000 other tracks have been submitted to Last.FM profiles through PandoraFM. * Thanks for being a part of it!</p>
<p></em>Wow!  Big number!  It's smaller than a lot of other numbers in the world, but that's my number!  Thanks everyone!

      <title>Go Bears!</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/01/ill-make-it-short-and-sweet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Go somewhere else, I mean.
I'm not a fan of the Chicago Bears, Chicago's media toward the Chicago Bears, or anything dealing with the Chicago Bears. When they lose the Chicago media is all "Rex can't cut it, The Bears can't make it, turnz0rv3r." and when they win it's all "Rex is the miracle worker, the Bears are the world's dream team!".  The city is the most two faced hypocritical fans of it's own team that i've ever seen.  They hate and love the team more than i've ever seen.  So either way they're "Right".</p>
<p>Maybe since I didn't grow up in Chicagoland i'm more disgusted than most, but seriously... 1985, get over it.  No other city dwells on a single win like Chicago does.  "Da Bears", "Da Coach".</p>
<p>Ok, i'm done.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>So i'm working on music</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/01/so-im-working-on-music</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I have about 15 songs now in various stages of completion.  There's probably only two or so that are "done", another two or so that are barely started, and the rest all in between.
I'm going through the phase now where I ignore all the original songs that I spent a lot of time on.  During the holidays I didn't have much time to spend on music, so it was a good cleansing period.  When I got back to it it's much better to start with new creative ideas then to just keep drilling the details of the old ones, so that's what i'm doing.  I go back and forth between wondering if I should have one song finished before I go to the next, but that's not how it's working out.  Once I get too saturated with the details that i've zoomed in too far to see the full picture of the songs i'm working on now then it'll be time to go back to the other ones again, and over and over again.  I guess.</p>
<p>I wish I could give myself some kind of timeline to finish everything, but that's really impossible.  I think probably 6 months though?  The hard part is I need to get hardware to track drums, and that's pretty expensive.  All in due time, I suppose.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Updating my site content</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/01/updating-my-site-content</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick update.  I'm removing a few things from my web site here.  First of all, removing any posts from my myspace blog... I deleted my myspace.com account.  Second, digg.com Diggs.  I found I wasn't digging stories just because I didn't want to flood my web page with things that probably aren't interesting.  And last, my Podshow.com blog, because I hate podshow and don't use it anyway.
So no loss, eh?</p>
<p>BTW, that PC World with PandoraFM is the February edition, so go get it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>headache clinic?</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/02/headache-clinic</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To go or not to go?  There's a place in chicago called the <a href="http://diamondheadache.com/">Diamond Headache Clinic</a>.  Being i've been on another bad downswing with the whole migraine thing i'm thinking I should see someone else... again.  Not that I haven't seen enough people in the past, but it hasn't helped all that much.  One thing I have got out of my neurologist is the wonderful drug of <a href="http://www.relpax.com/">Relpax</a>.  You take one when you feel it coming on, and it takes about 2hrs to kick in.  But it works almost all of the time, it really is a life saver.  Previously i'd have to stay home instead of going somewhere, now I have something that can help.  The problem is I don't have a way to prevent them from coming on, and I can only get 6 pills of Relpax at a time for insurance reasons.  I do take a pill every night, but it doesn't really seem to do anything.
I'll think about it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>So I cancelled cable</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/02/so-i-cancelled-cable-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Or so I tried.  I called anyway.  The people at Comcast hooked me up with a new "deal" that I just couldn't pass up, or something.  I have a feeling once I get the bill it won't be such a deal anymore.  They find ways to add on tons of stupid charges.  Add on all the other taxes and we'll see how much better off I am.
I got pissed at Comcast once and for all.  My plan was to cancel cable and just download shows through the new Amazon Unbox + TiVo setup or through the <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV + iTunes Store setup</a>.  I spent to much on my new TiVo that I figured it would work great as a media download appliance, but Amazon doesn't have much of selection compared to iTunes.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to find ways to free myself from the companies telling me how I should be spending my money.  I don't have enough money as it is, so it really bothers me when it goes somewhere when i'm not convinced it's what I want to be spending it on.  Lifetime, Oxygen, Hallmark Channel, Golf TV, ESPN, all things I don't want my money to go to.</p>
<p>So i'll give this new deal a shot for a month, but i'll probably cancel it still.  I'm willing to go without TV completely just to not have to deal with them and be a part of the empire.  I'll pay my $2 a week to watch LOST, another $2 for South Park, etc.  </p>
<p><em>($2 * # of Shows) * 4 weeks in a month &lt; What i'm paying comcast</em>.</p>
<p>And freedom is priceless.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Things and stuff, a real post in the spirit of a "blog"</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/02/things-and-stuff-a-real-post-in-the-spirit-of-a-blog</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So lots going on.  Where to begin?Today was the first meet-and-greet with the client's parent company.  Felt awkward that I'm not part of it at all.  When they welcomed me to the new company I wasn't going to correct them, I just nodded my head, shook hands and said it was nice to meet them.</p>
<p>I've been pretty confident all along that i'll be dispensed with after the acquisition.  I just don't think they realize there's consultants around yet.</p>
<p>This new company is a big company.  And when hearing them talk they had a similar feel to another big company I spent a lot of time and energy with: IBM.  IBM, the company that at more than one occasion called my consulting firm and told them to call me and say to not come in anymore.  The IBM that did a company wide disposal of all consultants because they had too many full time employees and not enough active projects that weren't canned.</p>
<p>Big companies are evil souless empires that care nothing more of the bottom line.  I happen to be an extremely small hinderance to a 14mil bottom line.  Omaha has "a bunch of CCIE's", they don't need us.  Omaha has the tools, the technology and the people with title of "employee".</p>
<p>And to be honest, if I get removed from CPWIC I'm not interested in the other options ahead of me.  I will not go back to NUV/NAM/NIM/NWQ/NWA, I just won't.  I'll reply to one of those "ATM Repair Man" ads on craiglist before I do that.  And the idea of being a "bouncer", doing piddly stuff here and there at random places isn't appealing to me either.  I like the idea of having some ownership of work.  That's what's disappointing if I have to leave now, there will never be any record of any of the effort I put in there.  I'd just be "a consultant who was there for a while". </p>
<p>Kelley thinks I should start actively looking around for another opportunity, but I don't know.</p>
<p>And for my music.  I realized something.  It's been 6 years since my last album.  I could come out with an album part Beatles, part Rolling Stones.  It could be as hip as the coolest thing you've ever heard.  It could have beats that could make your whole block relocate to another state.  After all of those qualities, i'd still think it'd be a large steaming pile of crapola.  So i'm not sure how to go about this.  I'm not happy about it at all.  Everything sounds awful, and it probably is.</p>
<p>So i'm not in the happiest place at the moment.  A bit "out of phase", if you will.  Odd how sometimes the only way you can describe a feeling or whatever is to use a phrase that doesn't describe anything at all.  "Out of phase" seems to fit, though.</p>
<p>I'll close this post with a couple things that do make me happy.</p>
<p>My MacBook Pro.  It makes me happy.
People have donated over $103 (after processing fees) to PandoraFM's hosting.  I owe $119 on the 20th, and money has been kind of tight for me lately.  The people using the service have each done their part to allow me to continue to run it.  That makes me happy.  I may even go as far as say it makes me have faith in this human race of ours.  I guess I won't push it, though.  Lost of people have never made a cent doing something they enjoyed.  I made $103.  Not as profit, mind you, as it goes right to the hosting provider.  But it still kind of makes me feel special, you know?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>wtf</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/02/wtf</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seriously.  Should had stayed in bed today.
Day went fine until I decided to go home from work and Metra decided to stop all trains from leaving Chicago on my train line.</p>
<p>So a few hours later (We're talking after 9pm finally) Metra decides I can finally go home and I do.  Too bad the train station wasn't shoveled or plowed when I got off the train.</p>
<p>My car isn't anywhere near where you get off the train, it's quite the long treck.  And it it's even longer when it's in feet of snow.  I was exhausted by the time I got home.  I was ready to crash.</p>
<p>But the amount of snow waiting for me in the driveway was crazy, I couldn't even park my car legally.  So I spent another 45min or so shoveling and trying to beat off the cramps that keep popping up due to my lack of physical ability.</p>
<p>So here I am finally able to go to bed and I can't, i'm just too worked up.  That and my ear ache.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If you take the sleek outside face away from a mac, is it then just a PC?  What's inside?  Can it be rebuilt as something new?  Or should it just get trashed?  It's far from operational without any kind of interface.</p>

      <title>Man, it's SXSW time already?  How time flies.  I'll sure not be busy.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/03/man-its-sxsw-time-already-how-time-flies-ill-sure-be-busy</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been a whole year already since I hadn't gone to SXSW 2006 and it's time again for me to not go to SXSW 2007.  I don't have my hotel all booked and my flights are not ready to go.  I won't be arriving in Austin tonight.</p>
<p>I'm really pumped about the panels that are scheduled, I can't wait to not see them.</p>
<p>Did you see the lineups of the bands?  It's going to not be like my own personal woodstock, i'm pumped.  I'll probably not meet up with Robert Scoble tonight after no drinks with Mark Cuban to discuss no business ventures.  I'd tell you the details, but there are none.</p>
<p>Anyone else excited about the keynote by Pete Townshend?  The Pete Townshend?  I am!  I won't be there with bells on.  I might even not live blog it.</p>
<p>Phil Terrone is doing a Keynote on the 11th.  Phil did the first podcast I ever heard, and is possibly the reason I listened to the second.  It's quite symbolic for me to not get a chance to meet him.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to South by Southwest 2007.  I hope you enjoy it as much as i'm not going to.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seriously?  Damnit.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/03/seriously-damnit-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the person I despise more than anyone else on a professional level now is my boss.  I've butted heads with him for years.  YEARS.  I remember getting into it with him at both our past clients.  I've dealt with him all this time as a peer.  He had no authority.  Sure he'd push his weight around, tell you he's right and you're wrong, but I could blow him off without a problem.  I won't be able to deal with him at this new level.  He already has an air of superiority for no good reason.  Now he has a reason.
He listens to nothing than what's going on in his own head.  His ego is all that guides him.  He's fine talking about a tv show, but if you want to talk about anything meaningful he won't let you have a word in.  And if you try, he'll tell you you're wrong.  Plain fucking wrong, and you should shut the hell up.  He's just a plain bad person for someone to have to deal with.</p>
<p>The other week, I was talking to him about work things, at work.  WORK THINGS AT WORK.  CRAZY!  Catch your breath.  Ok, so, work things at work.  And he would continue to interrupt me over and over again to leave to take personal phone calls dealing with personal business locking himself in a conference room.  Wtf?  I'm trying to discuss work and you're leaving to yell at someone about some stupid shit.  I'm going through a divorce and i'm certainly not trying to make my workplace pay for it through this whole thing.  I guess he was just training himself to be a manager.  He did a great job.  He got promoted for it.</p>
<p>I already have no say on how things work here.  I don't know how i'll get less of a say, but he'll find a way.  I understand that.  It's called the corporate latter.  I don't expect anyone to listen to me at my pay grade.</p>
<p>I feel a bit deceived that it wasn't mentioned it was going to happen before it did.  To give some warning before it took place.  He was made aware that he was my boss without me being made aware that he was my boss.</p>
<p>Good timing isn't it?  I don't really want to start hating my job right now, but I can see that coming.</p>
<p>But because stability is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT right now, i'll put my blinders on and i'll TRY not to kick his ass every day.  I'll move my cube if I have to.  Communicate via email.  That would work.  He's only unbearable in person.  In email he's just another person.  I'll pretend it's someone I respect telling me what to do.  That might work.  No meetings, no words.  Just emails.  Maybe the developers will let me sit by them?</p>
<p>So my fuse is short at the moment.  And i'm not sure how i'm going to handle things.  </p>
<p>First my personal life, and now my professional life.</p>
<p>So much for work being my escape.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The useless and useful</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/03/the-useless-and-useful</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So i'm picky with things sometimes.  For instance, on my desktop I like having little widgets.  However, I can never seem to find exactly what I want.  It's easy to find something that gives me the weather.  It's impossible to find something that gives it in fahrenheit and celsius, not to mention in multiple locations at once.
It's easy to find a little applet that shows that I have a wireless signal.  It's not so easy to find something that displays current IP addresses.</p>
<p>So when I ran into <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/">GeekTool</a>, a application made to put plain text on your desktop it clicked for me.  I'll write my own.  It's generally the only way I get what I want, anyway.</p>
<p>Now I have good old fashioned plain text displaying the stuff I want on my desktop, and I can continue on from here if I think of other ideas.</p>
<p>Behold.</p>

      <title>And now things really get messy.  I'm losing my car.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/04/and-now-things-really-get-messy-im-losing-my-car</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, more messy than the dirt thrown all over my stuff, and the eternal smell of incense in the house.
I received a copy of the settlement proposal yesterday from my attorney.  Imagine my surprise reading that if I don't get Kelley off my car loan by July 1st I have to sell my car and pay off the loan.  This is after she said she would say on my car loan to make my "life easier".  Since Kelley has allowed me to move back in the house July 1st is also the day I must move out, and until then I'm to pay her $1,000/month.</p>
<p>So I emailed her and asked what the deal with the car was.  She said she'd stay on my loan, and now I get a paper saying i'm losing my car.  She replied:</p>
<p>"Did you want me to stay on it?  I can, if that's what you want to do.  I wasn't lying.  I just thought you'd want me off of it.  Please call me."</p>
<p>I called, we discussed.  She said she'd stay on the loan and would contact her attorney today to change the papers to have it in writing.</p>
<p>I get home and she tells me she changed her mind and she will not stay on my loan and it will need to be sold by the new date of September 1st or find a way to get her name off the loan.  I explained that i'm starting a new life and I can't afford to get a new loan at a higher rate right now.  She doesn't care.  So now that i'm losing everything else, i'm also going to lose my car.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>And things got worse</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/04/and-things-got-worse</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the phone yesterday Kelley told me she wants me out.  Point blank, out.  Find somewhere else to live.  She was screaming at me on the phone and said some really awful things.  She told me that I took advantage of her mother's death.  I don't even know what that means.
So I left, and came back to get stuff to move it out of the house.  When I got home the house full of smoke.  Just completely filled.  It was near impossible to breathe.  She was burning so much incense that it had engulfed the whole house.  She lit it in the two rooms I spend time in.  The room I sleep in, and the room where my computer goes.  That's no coincidence, she wanted to make sure I didn't come back.  She knows I have problems breathing, so that's how she did it.  Poor cats and dog had to deal with that all night.</p>
<p>I went to grab some clothes and to my surprise they were covered in potting soil.  Yes, potting soil.  It looks as if she took some from the plant in the computer room and threw it all over my clothes.  If I hadn't seen this with my own eyes I would had never believed it.  The same soil was piled on top of my bluetooth apple keyboard on the desk.  It's ruined.</p>
<p>I didn't think of taking pictures of that, and I'm stupid.  I should have.  I did think of taking a picture before moving the stuff in the driveway, since I knew i'd be writing this post today.</p>
<p>I was so afraid what I didn't move was going to be destroyed.  I don't have much right now, but I do have some belongings that are mine.  And I completely was convinced that by the end of the night I would not have those anymore either.</p>
<p>So here's most of my audio, computer, and network gear.  All packed up as best as possible in the driveway.<span style="font-size: 0pt" /></p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Gabe,
What the hell kind of medication is she on?  If nothing then I think she needs to be. Like breaking your heart isn't enough?  Such wickedness from someone who once said she cared.  This is just proposterous to me - seems as though she wants to leave you with nothing and keep you from any form of support mechanism.   Mental anguish is a form of abuse and jeopardizing your well-being as well as the pets - oh my God!! What was she thinking? - Oh ya, she wasn't.   Yoga my ass - sure not working that program.</p>
<p>Ok so I hope you have a safe place to be now.  Hotel, motel, friend or shelter if you have to. </p>
<p>BE SAFE</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just got a Sprint Cell Phone bill for almost $400.  It must have to do with the change since Kelley left my sprint account.

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>But, at some point, it will get better...  Promise.
Life's a roller coaster.  Sometime you're on the downfall with no end in sight, but the bottom does come.  And then you get to enjoy a long climb to the top.  I think it's important to remember when you're at the top, tough times lie ahead - and when you're at the bottom or in that general vicinity, things will get better.</p>

      <title>Day 5.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/04/day-5</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On day five.  Believe it or not, as time goes by, no matter how much you hope... you have *less* money than you had then when you started.  When you get paid, you get more, but when between pay periods the amount of money you have does go down.  That does lead it to be pretty difficult to finding a new place to live and throwing together the funds needed to starting a new life.  When you're only counting the time you've known in days, not weeks or months.. what exactly are you supposed to do?  You think happy thoughts, I guess.  What else can you do?  Nobody is going to come to me offering me a free apartment for being a way cool dude.  They all will want money.  Money I don't have because i've only known I'll need an apartment for the past five days.
I'm all dressed up, with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Sorry, that's PACKED up.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Me again Gabe,Not sure I have any good words of wisdom to share on this other than keep your chin up and put faith in tomorrow.  Grandma Kangas said "why waist precious time worrying about those things you cannot control - let today be and tomorrow will take care of itself" Can't say that I myself can do that every day but in those really trying times it does seem to sooth the mind anyway.  This too shall pass.  If you had any desire to visit this way - know that the door is always open (i would make the cats sleep in the basement!) WE HAVE SNOW  SNOW  SNOW  - yuck.  Just when you think the UP is having spring   ha ha ha

      <title>End of a weekend</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/04/end-of-a-weekend</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kelley stayed at a co-worker's house to play with their kids Saturday night.  I missed having her at home.
But today she came home, I got Kelley and I dinner, we were watching tv.  I thought we were really enjoying each other's company, and it was nice not to be stressed out for a while.  After a show, she mentioned she was going up to take a shower.  She stopped on the way up to say something really mean.  "Don't you love the cats?  Oh, it doesn't matter what you think anymore.  It doesn't matter."  And then walked away.  It really hurt.</p>
<p>She went to take her shower, and I went on my computer upstairs.  She came out and I noticed her packing her bags and getting dressed to go out. I asked her what's going on, and where she's going.  She just kept saying "I need to go."  I asked if anything was wrong, she said "No, well yes" and just pushed past me, shoving things in a bag as she walked.  I asked when she'd be back, I asked again what was going on, and she just walked out the door.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do.  I love her so much.  That's my wife.  She's my girl, and she's literally walking out of my life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Friday the 13th.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/04/friday-the-13th</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's Friday the 13th.  I still have nowhere to live.  A payroll mistake by the company I work for set me back a little, so i'm not too happy about that.  The last thing I need is for outside problems to impact me at this point.  I need all the help I can get.
Things are changing at work, again.  At least in the "big picture" sense, not at the "chair level".  Ever since Eric took charge i've been thrown to the side, no longer a part of anything here.  I get no emails dealing with anything, and any discussion i'm left out of.  We used to all sit down and make decisions together, but now it's just him.  At the moment, he's having a discussion with a bunch of other people and I have no clue wtf they're talking about.  But if they want to actively filter what information I get, therefore limiting my usefulness, then go ahead.  It's his loss, not mine, and I have more important things to worry about.  If he wants to feel self-important, then he can go ahead and do it.  But he sure looks like an ass.  Again, I have larger problems then Mr. Perfect.</p>
<p>Things at home aren't any better.  Kelley is actively pushing me away, and I just want it all over.  It's a fight I just want to end, but they won't call the match and i'm in the corner just getting my ass kicked day after day.</p>
<p>I forgot my phone at home today, so if anyone sees this, yeah, i don't have it.  So don't call.</p>
<p>Starting to bookmark things i'll need coming up, so i'll have them at easy access.  If you see something I should have in my apartment coming up, then bookmark it via del.icio.us as for:gabek and i'll add it to my tags.  My list so far:<a href="http://del.icio.us/gabek/apartment"> http://del.icio.us/gabek/apartment</a>.</p>
<p>I wonder when i'm sitting on my death bed, if someone can make it think that I spent my whole life fishing.  Not that I went to work, had a failed marriage, and generally lived a fucked up existence.  Make me think I went fishing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Got served with my papers</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/04/got-served-with-my-papers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right out of a tv show.  The doorbell rang and a stranger said "Are you Gabriel Kangas?" I said yes, and he handed me a stack of papers and walked away.
What a bitch.  She wanted to make this "easy", she could had went to the county clerk's office and filled out a form and had been done with it.  But now I'm just getting pissed off.  I keep getting official paper after paper saying "Gabe will do this, Gabe will do that.  Gabe will give up this, Gabe will not ever do that."  Nowhere does anywhere state anything that Kelley has to give up, or anything Kelley HAS to do.  It's only shit I HAVE to do and i'm getting a little fucking upset over being a punching bag.  If I had a scanner i'd scan this crap in so everyone could see it, it's enough to get anyone on edge.</p>
<p>The papers say we haven't lived as husband and wife since November, 2006.  Complete lie.  It says that so Kelley can have her May divorce.  If I agree that to be the truth that's called perjury, and is against the law.  Kelley already signed the papers stating all was fact, so she's already broken the law.  The last thing I need is to have a court fine or jail time or some other crap.  I'm going to have to consult with my attorney on this, I feel really uncomfortable with blatant lies.  The way it works in Illinois is:
<em>A six month separation is required if both parties agree to use this ground. Otherwise, a two year separation is needed before "No-fault" can be employed.</em></p>
<p><em>"Separation", as it applies to this ground, has been extended to also include living under the same roof but not as Husband and Wife (i.e. no physical contact, freedom to come and go without explanation, separate laundry, checking accounts, etc.).</em></p>
<p>Well, we slept in the same bed until a few weeks ago.  Not quite six months.  I'm doing my laundry myself for the first time right now, as I type.  Not quite six months there either.  Lies.  She's full of lies.</p>
<p>Also, the money I owe ($3000) refers to a percentage of the amount of debt accrued during our marriage (that's the law, pre-marriage debt is not shared - she says it does),  due to christmas gifts purchased for my family.  Well, if we were separated since November, how was she buying Christmas gifts for my family in December?</p>
<p>The court form also has my title wrong for my job, so that's an inaccuracy.</p>
<p>So many things wrong with this.  So many lies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

She clearly wants to be single in May for her own reasons.  What a selfish woman.</p>
<p>They serve restraining orders in the same way.  That's stone cold tactics right there.  I think she's just doing things to try and provoke retaliation.  She clearly underestimates your patience.  If you did retaliate and play on her level then she can emotionally justify everything she's done as being the right choice because she leaver her 'mean husband'.  heh won't happen.  sorry wifey you're going to have to live with the guilt.  You had a loyal loving husband and you kicked him aside.</p>
<p>Remember your passiveness is a strength.  Not a weakness.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

So what door bell was it that rang?  Same one you have heard for the last several years, huh?  And the same place that is costing you $1,000 a month to keep a roof over your head?

      <title>New Rules</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/04/new-rules</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below is the email sent to Kelley outlining the new rules of our little situation.  Enjoy.-------
The truth is we have not been separated since November.  You have taken part in perjury.  For me to agree to the statement would be doing the same.  However, if you agree to my requests from here on, I am willing to listen and accept your explanation of the statement as fact.</p>
<p>I've had enough of receiving paperwork full of demands from you when I've recieved no equal paperwork telling me what I'll get in return.  You asked to make this easy, but instead sent a list of demands in the form of a settlement proposal and had me served in an insulting fashion with a court summons.  You could have gone to the County Clerk's office and filled out paperwork, but instead sought the assistance of an attorney.  These are not the acts of someone looking for things to be easy; these are the acts of someone on the offensive trying to embarrass, take advantage of, and punish me.  You would not have been willing to pay the $2500 retainer for a "simple" divorce.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order for you to get the quick divorce you want so badly, the new rules are as follows:</p>
<p>1) There are to be no verbal agreements.  Everything is to be written down in detail.  It is to be filed through your attorney and copies sent to me.  It is not to be changed unless the same process is repeated.  If you aim to add flexibility to any clause, it must be formally added to the paperwork.  All agreements and paperwork will become official documents in the divorce proceeding, as you cannot be trusted with your word.</p>
<p>2) You will be honest from this moment on.  You will tell me what is going on with respect to the divorce.  You will no longer hide things being written on papers.  There are to be no more surprises.  You will cease lying about items of contention.  You will no longer pretend this divorce is for the both of us.  I'm well aware of your infidelity in the marriage with Dan Zink and your desire to push the divorce through quickly due to his involvement.</p>
<p>3) I'm to receive no more paperwork from your counsel with demands of what I'm to do for you.  If I'm to waive all claim to your bank accounts, you won't do the same for mine?  You keep your car, and I have to sell mine?  There is not one word on file with what I'll be leaving the house with, and all demands have been a one-way street.  This will change.  Attached is my division of assets, as you have neglected to create one yourself.  A copy will be forwarded to your attorney.  The list supplied may be changed by our internal discussion, and the final agreement of property will be again filed as a formal piece of the divorce paperwork.  This is just my recommendation, as not everything could be thought of at once.  I want the final version completed by Saturday, May 5th.</p>
<p>4) Concessions must be made since you are the one who wanted the divorce.  Keeping everything except the furniture you admitted you would dispose of once I left the house is not a fair and just way to handle the situation.</p>
<p>5) There is to be no more destruction of my personal property.  To do so would be grounds for immediate cancellation of all agreements and the police will be contacted.</p>
<p>6) The burden of proof with regards to debt allocation was purely on your shoulders.  Due to the fact that you have provided no invoices, receipts, and the credit cards are only in your name, you have not proven that the responsibility of debt does not fall solely on your shoulders. Marital debt is only accumulated within the time of the marriage, not before, and not once separation takes place.  Under penalty of law, you signed that we separated in November, 2006, yet explained that most of the debt accumulated is due to purchasing Christmas gifts in our marriage.  With this date of separation you gave, we could have never spent a Christmas as husband and wife, therefore your reason is invalid.  However, I agreed to pay $3,000, and that will remain to be true unless further demands are made by you or this agreement cannot be determined.</p>
<p>7) There is to be no packing, labeling, organizing, or separating of my personal belongings.  This will be done on my time in the way I see fit.  With things being boxed up, there is no way to know what items are coming with me and what items are not.  This would be a violation of these new terms, as I'm to know exactly what I'm in possession of and what is rightfully mine.</p>
<p>8) I have no responsibility to continue to be represented by counsel.  It is my decision.  Therefore, all requests, amendments, or statements are to be sent directly to me.  I will make the decision on who I want to involve and when.</p>
<p>Any change, debate, or disregard of these new terms will result in a two-year contested divorce due to, but not limited to, the date of separation, reasons of dissolution, and settlement agreement.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Gabe</p>

      <title>Some updates</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/04/some-updates</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So things got pretty heated the other night.  She wanted us to start giving each other "space", and then asked if I'd order us a pizza.  I stepped out of the house to get some fresh air, not knowing if I would go somewhere or not to get out of the house and she said "you need to go", turned off the lights, and locked the door.  Good thing I had my keys.
Before that we discussed the 40% of debt that i'll be owing.  I thought it was acceptable, but now the more that I think about it, and the more I talk to people... i'll need more information about it.  It's a credit card that was around before I even knew Kelley.  The card doesn't have my name on it, I don't know the balance, and I don't know what has ever been charged to it.  I'm sure some percentage of whatever is owed on that card was in our 1.5yrs of marriage, but i'm sure a big chunk of it isn't.  I'd rather not pay 40% of a balance of a card when I've never seen an invoice.  She won't tell me what the actual dollar amount I'll owe is, she just keeps saying 40%.  It should be 40% of what we accrued during our time being married.  Not 40% of total debt.  Illinois law says debt before marriage is your debt, debt during marriage is shared.  So I don't know how this will work out coming up, possibly my attorney will get involved.  Speaking of...</p>
<p>My attorney called me yesterday.  It turns out he remembers I did computer work, and needs some network help at his office.  How about that?  He said he'll pay me or just discount any services i'll need from him.  I'll take the later.</p>
<p>More things are boxed up, and I still have nowhere to live once I sign on the dotted line.  That's the day she can legally kick me out.  And at this rate she will.  She said she's "sick of playing these games."  I don't know what games those are, but she let me know she's sick of them.  Well i'm sick of getting divorced, how about that?  I didn't ask for this bullshit, it's just being thrown at me.  She said "it's not a bunch of money" to get an apartment, and I just need to deal and do what I need to do.  Well, it is a "bunch of money" when you haven't prepared for divorce like she has.  It's a "bunch of money" when I don't have the bottomless pit of cash that she has with her dad.  This whole thing is all about a "bunch of money".</p>
<p>So I love her, I live with her, I help pay for the house, I help pay off everything that's gone into the house in the three years we've lived there, just like a married man and his wife do.  And what do I get out of it?  40% of some mysterious debt.  She'll some day sell the house, make money on it, and i'll still be paying some credit card bill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>It's stupid she'd start something like that when everything was going smoothly.  Yeah i'd start a heated debate over that crap too.  But if she wants to play hardball it'll only hurt her more in the end.  Little does she know, you have the upper hand.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Gabe,
I'm glad to hear the attorney will owe you a favor or two, that could come in real handy.  DO NOT sign off on 40% of that card, until you know EXACTLY what 40% entails.  You know we're dealing with a fruit loop here, god only knows how much debt she's put on that card.  She may have donated half of her net income to the Buddhist faith.  Somebody call the men with the upside down butterfly nets and request a petite straight-jacket and a private rubber room.
It's hard to believe this used to be one of my best friends.  Maybe it's all caused by the 6th cow being in the wrong chakra and jumping into the House of Jupiter.  I'm sorry, I just can't help myself.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Gabe,Good attorney you have there!  Check the legal advice thoroughly 40% seems outrageous.  And it looks to me like someone has been studying her plays well in that game.</p>
<p>OK so I won't reply to everything - but I will be reading..... just sending some positive reinforcement your way.  Some oh let's see, ah 12 years ago when I went through the big "D" (quite different circumstances I know) but the point being made is support mechanism - sure would have been nice to have that.  The "I told ya so" comments just didn't cut it.  </p>
<p>Take it in stride...........</p>

      <title>Started packing my music equipment</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/04/started-packing-my-music-equipment</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Obvious to say I won't be working no music again for a long while.  Everything will be in boxes.  That started tonight.  Kelley has been packing my clothes and other personal belongings, but tonight I made the first move of my music equipment.
Kelley wanted me to get certified in music production this year so I could start recording bands here at our house.  She's taking that away from me.  She's taking me being able to drum away from me.  She's taking the freedom of the only thing that made me happy, being able to make that fucking music.  Now it's all going to be in fucking boxes.</p>
<p>She's taken everything from me.  A month ago I had a wife, a home, a life.  And in one fell swoop she's taken it all from me.  No more planning to record bands at our home.  I won't have a home.</p>
<p>I didn't do anything wrong.  Why has this happened to me.  Good friday my ass.  The only thing good would be if I don't wake up to see Shitty Saturday.</p>
<p>I was so close to the final stretch on that album.  It may never see the light of day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Geez Gabe, This is like reading my own journal, after a few weeks of being off the Cymbalta.  She can't take away your talent.  And boxes can be unpacked just as easily as they were packed.  You will have a home again, it may take a few weeks, maybe even a month or so, but the point is it will happen........and it will be YOUR HOME, that house in Oak Forest has never been home to anyone but Kelley.  You know it and I know it.  I look forward to talking to you when you get back from Wisconsin.
Later my friend.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Gabe, Time is the only obstacle to face now.  It is YOUR talent, YOUR music and will always be that.  There will be a place to continue with and finish the album.  Don't throw in the towel - she doesn't deserve an ounce of satisfaction.  
 Anger was not a complete emotion for me when I read this post - frickin' A.  And I have nothing more to reply baffled, at a loss for words; when indeed there seems to be so much spinning around in my mind at the moment.  More than a mere bump in the road of life that can't be driven around.  Take another route.  
 Ok to tell your aunt to get a "corn" dog for lunch.  Just know I care alot.  </p>

      <link>/blog/2007/05/an-update</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm not allowed to post things to my blog anymore.  I'm not sure if i'm allowed to say that, but my friends and family deserve a quick post.
I can't tell you why, because i'm not allowed to tell you.</p>
<p>I can't tell you when i'll be able to again, i'm sorry.  I thought password protecting the posts from the public would be over and above what i'd be expected to do, but nothing is good enough.  I'll have to remove all the posts so nobody can see them again, it's not my choice, but it's what I have to do.</p>
<p>None of this is really fair, and I don't really know what to say or do about it.  I'm being attacked from all sides and I haven't done anything wrong.</p>

      <title>mmmm steak</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/05/mmmm-steak</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the most delicious steak ever last night.  I went to <a href="http://www.ruthschris.com/">Ruth's Chris Steakhouse</a> and it rocked.  They flash cook the meat at 1800F, and the plate comes out at 500F.  Had awesome sides of potatoes and some great desert to top it all off.
My apartment kicks ass.  The kitchen is complete and i'm able to move everything in there now.  I got home late last night, so I haven't had a chance to do that yet.  But at least my microwave is no longer next to my computers, and my coffee machine is no longer in my bathroom.</p>
<p>It's pretty warm in there, so I have the AC running now.  It has a thermostat on it so it'll only turn on when it gets hot, so that's nice.  I'm going to purchase a second AC unit to install on the opposite side, and that'll work really nice I think.  Maybe I won't need it, but I probably will.  I don't like heat, at all.</p>
<p>Maybe this weekend i'll setup my drums, I think they'll look really nice in there.  Plus I need to get them off the floor.  I won't be able to play them yet, but I will soon.  I'm going to buy <a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/product/Hart-Dynamics-Kontrol-Screen-Magnum-Drumhead-?sku=445444">Mesh Drumheads </a>and <a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/product/ddrum-Trigger-Kit?sku=440025">Electronic Triggers</a> to hook my acoustic drums up to my drum sampler.  Then the drums will be completely silent, and i'll be able to play them all I want through headphones.  I still have a $100 gift certificate to Musician's Friend, so that'll come in handy when purchasing all that equipment for the big drum conversion project.  It won't be right away, but it's certainly on my radar.</p>
<p>I'm going to have to go out and buy a tv sometime soon.  It'd be nice to have.  Being I want to purchase an Apple TV, but that's useless without a TV to plug it into.</p>
<p>I have a lot of things to buy, don't I?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>So sue me and I moved into my new apartment</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/05/so-sue-me-and-i-moved-into-my-new-apartment</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don't have a lot of time, as I need to finish getting ready for work, but i'd thought i'd post something up.
I moved into my new apartment, and it kicks ass.  Everything went really smooth.  Nothing is really broke, no walls with holes in them, nothing crazy.  It went really well, and I had a great crew helping me out.  I'll get more into the apartment later, but I'm just glad to finally be here.  Check out <a href="http://www.real-ity.com/videos.php">my Videos page</a> to see some short tours.</p>
<p>Secondly, I got my final divorce papers.  I'm under no pressure to sign them, and i'm certainly not going to.  Why?  There is a clause that if I post to my blog and it mentions Kelley, she's suing me.  I'm 100% serious, she's going to sue me.  Things keep happening that I couldn't make up if I tried, it's really quite amazing.  So she's only hurting herself at this point, because I'm not going to sign her papers.  Her fault, not mine.  Try and take away free speech, and things get messy.  I'll be contacting the <a href="http://www.eff.org/bloggers/">EFF</a> today.  It'd be different if I was posting things like "Kelley, man, she's awful.  I think she's a cocaine addict.  I'm pretty sure she killed 14 kittens and ate them for dinner last night."  Then fine, sue me for libel or something.  But you can't sue someone for telling their own story, the truth, just because you happen to be a part of it.  It's her fault she made herself a part of this.</p>
<p>Enjoy your monday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/05/welcome-back-my-friends-to-the-show-that-never-ends</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it took me a while longer than I hoped, but here I am.
Kelley filed a restraining and gag order against me.  That means no talking about the divorce, at all, in any manner.  On top of that after it's all over, the restraining order kicks in and says I can't post to my blog, at all, mentioning the divorce.  Or that I was ever married, or anything.</p>
<p>Kind of dumb, isn't it?  Well, I'm back and I'm taking care of those issues now.</p>
<p>The posts are back, so go ahead and read the back story and catch up if you've missed it.  The reasons I took down the posts in the first place, and stopped posting was the fact that Kelley was going at the whole blogging in such a broad way that anything I posted, dealing with her or not, could be used against me and say it causes her "intentional emotional distress".  I could say "I got a new toaster today", and she could say that's me insulting the fact she gave me a toaster in the divorce settlement, and then take me to court for breaking the order.  Do you trust she wouldn't do that?  Me neither.</p>
<p>This blog is is so my friends and family can follow me in my life.  It's not for me to gain any kind of advantage in any pending legal issues as Kelley said.  I've had this web site for well over 10 years.  I'm pretty sure I didn't even know her then.  Yeah, I didn't.  I checked.</p>
<p>So i'm sorry i've been away.  It was certainly not my intention.  I was just trying to save myself as much as possible from the litigation happy ex.</p>
<p>I'm so glad you could attend.  Come inside, come inside.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What do you do?  A post on Jaiku.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/05/what-do-you-do-a-post-on-jaiku</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've had a Jaiku account now for a couple weeks, I really like it.  It's a one stop shop to answer a question someone may ask you like "What do you do online?"  Or "What do you like?"  Or "Where's your stuff?"
Increasingly many people have many different things spread throughout the internet.  Bookmarks, playlists, blogs, etc etc.  I've gone the extra step of building my website around the fact that there is no central repository of a person online anymore, and it allows me to add things as more things show up in my online life.  So it's the one place people can go.</p>
<p>With Jaiku it's the same idea.  A stream of a person on a simple page.  Songs, bookmarks, blogs, photos, whatever.  It's a good place to send people to check out what you're about without giving 10 different URLs.</p>
<p>Mine is at <a href="http://gabek.jaiku.com/">http://gabek.jaiku.com/</a>.  Check it out.  Do you have a Jaiku?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A new beginning</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/a-new-beginning</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thursday marked a big day in my life.  A page was turned, and a new chapter began.
Sometimes things happen that you can't change, and sometimes they don't always go the way you hope they would.  Sometimes you force things into your life and they cause a wound that just won't heal.  There are good days, there are bad days.  But you know in the end that it won't work out, and it would eventually be gone forever.</p>
<p>Thursday marked that point where it would be gone forever.</p>
<p>There's been many days where I told myself i'd make it work, that i'd find a way.  We've gone together to see specialists, and even took a break for a short duration to see if anything would change.  Have you ever had feelings so deeply about something that you just ignored the obvious?  Thursday I had to face those facts that I now have to move on.</p>
<p>Yes, Thursday I took the tragus piercing out of my left ear.  It's been almost a year and a half, and it never really healed properly.  When I get sick, like I am now, it flares up, bleeds and gets really gross.  So please allow me some time to mourn, as I'll surely miss that piercing for some time to come.  It's been there day in and day out for me, and now it's gone.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, <strong>and</strong> I got divorced on Thursday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A request to put some life into PandoraFM</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/a-request-to-put-some-life-into-pandorafm</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So PandoraFM version 3 is a little long in the tooth, i'm aware.  It's almost a year old now.  I'm proud to say, it still seems to work great!  One year and 2.6 million tracks later people still use it every day, and people are still discovering it for the first time.
That being said, the people who have been using it deserve something new.  At the very least Pandora has updated their color scheme and PandoraFM no longer looks as pretty with regards to matching it.  Last.FM has added tons of functionality with regards to a new API version and an embedded flash radio player.  There's a lot to be excited about and a lot to take advantage of in this space.</p>
<p>However, I'm not the one to do it.  At least not right now.</p>
<p>I could go into a list of reasons why, but this isn't about me, this is about PandoraFM and what it deserves.  And at this point it deserves some attention.</p>
<p>So I'm posting to my personal blog first to see if anyone runs into this post that is seriously interested in putting time and effort into the project.  Maybe not one person, maybe a team.  If so, i'd be more than happy to be a proud member of that team if you let me :)</p>
<p>So if you run across this and you're seriously interested, you seriously have ideas, and you seriously have the drive then drop me an email.  If you're not sure, then it's probably not for you, and that's ok too.</p>
<p>And one last important note that may take away PandoraFM for good that you can help with.  We're lucky to currently have Pandora and Last.FM and the multitude of other internet radio sources out there.  I hope in a couple months we can say the same.  Due to the copyright royalty board rate increases, I'm not so sure we will.  If that passes, then this whole thing is moot and the life of this, and many other projects is over already anyway.  So do your part and visit <a href="http://www.savenetradio.org">www.savenetradio.org</a>.  And once that hurdle is passed hopefully we can all take a huge sigh of relief and just enjoy the music again.

      <title>An update now that things are done</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/an-update-now-that-things-are-done</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So yeah.  I'm divorced.  She's still being really awful about things, though.
I've let her know that if she hates me so much, she should stop reading my blog.  I seriously don't get it.  Nobody that she knows reads it.  She never read it before we separated.  She's just trying to make my life difficult.</p>
<p>But being she probably won't stop reading, and I guess my prose here is just so thrilling i'm going to have to set a ground rule for myself.  The term is "Public Disclosure of Private Facts."  Private facts, in this sense, is a legal term.  It is defined as more or less things that only you, the other person, and probably their Doctor would ever know.  It doesn't mean things they don't want said, or things that are embarrassing.  It is a legal term and is quite specific.</p>
<p>So if I said "Sam is an ass."  That is acceptable.  If I said "Sam emailed me and called me an ass."  That is acceptable.  If I said "Sam told me he has a huge mole on his ass", that may not be acceptable.</p>
<p>So it turns out the joint account I planned on paying off with Kelley, that was agreed to in our settlement agreement has already been closed.  I agreed to pay that account because it had my name on it.  She closed it without telling me, and then put on the divorce papers that she would close it once I paid it off.  Except she lied, because she already closed it without telling anyone.  So this is the second time she's committed purgery in this whole thing now.  Oh well, what's done is done.  I expect no less from her, really.  Interestingly, she won't give me the payment information to pay what i'm legally obligated to pay.  She said I can send it directly to her.  Nice, but no.</p>
<p>Went to her house on Sunday, and Dan was there.  I asked Kelley to show some respect and not have him there, but she just wants to make things more difficult.  I'm not sure why.  If I were her i'd do *everything* in my power to make this quick and easy.  Except she's to make this long and difficult.  And it's still not over.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>The Bill Of Rights
Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. </p>
<p>_________________________________________________________
While I'm aware that we do live in Bushworld and most of our civil rights have been trampled.  I, as a paralegal also know a thing or two about the law, and in order to claim slander or defamation of character you have to PROVE that you have suffered monetary damages or setback to your career, home, livelihood, etc.  Such proof, does not exist in this case.  However, we could prosecute her for "harassment" for contacting me on my personal email after I specifically told her never to do so again.  The scales of justice swing both ways.
So, as someone who is not party to the legal action or with access to any "private information".........Let me just say that "SHE," as my mother put it so eloquently a few days ago---"has a screw loose."  She goes through more moods in a day than the average American goes through in a year.  In a few months, this current "phase" or "trend"-- or whatever the fuck we're calling them this week--will be over.  She'll be on to a new partner, a new "phase" and hell, probably even a new religion.  So, take heart my friend in the fact that you have escaped with your sanity intact.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Well, well.......Response to the CONGRATS first of all.  I get the impression that when that was written someone was looking in the mirror and I don't mean you Gabe.  Quite amazing how things got turned around there - who was it that wanted divorce and yet retaliates?  Be so very greatful that no children were involved.  My big "D" was final August 31, 1995, (oh, I trampled too!) and he NEVER goes away.  The last I heard, he plans to ruin my life.  The reason being, child support.  Been a squeaky wheel to the courts since he has over $25 thousand in arrearage.  Always thought that parents were responsible to support their kids. But he can somehow own two homes in Florida and still cry poverty. Psycho Billy - used to own a Cadillac, ha.
Just the tip of my iceberg and still sane, I think......</p>
<p>So, smile often.  You should be congratulated.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Happy Friday, Friends</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/happy-friday-friends</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a good birthday.  Went to Pepes and had Tacos.  Drank some Margar33tas.  Played Super Mario Brothers 3, and drank some beer.  I can't really ask for more than that.
<a href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/IMG_8768.JPG" onclick="window.open('http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/IMG_8768.JPG','popup','width=2592,height=1944,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/IMG_8768-tm.jpg" height="100" width="133" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Img 8768" /></a></p>
<p>I got my furniture in.  Even with more crap, my apartment still looks empty.  Argh.  I try so hard.  At least I have a dining room table and coffee table and some chairs now.  No more eating pizza off the floor.  I'm looking at a new slipcover for my couch, since the old one was all full of cat hair, so I washed it, and now it won't fit.  I washed it in cold water, but it's still messed up.  <a href="http://www.bemz.com/products/2/3/17/0/24/front/">http://www.bemz.com/products/2/3/17/0/24/front/</a> those people have some cool ones.  I'll probably just get another plain black one to match my decor.  </p>
<p>I put up some shelves this past week, so that helped too.  More stuff off the floor.  And I started to put my audio equipment together.  I booted up the PC and loaded up some files.  A HUGE sigh of relief from me when it all worked.  I've feared for the day I turned it on, because I was really afraid that It wasn't going to after all the transit.  It was moved a few times, and I honestly do not know what i'd do if I lost the data on that drive.  I know, I know, backups.  But it's not just the files.  It's the whole environment that's important.  All the plugins and programs and everything.  A reinstall and copying back of the data files wouldn't work.  I had planned on cloning the drive with Ghost previously, but then "The Potting Soil" incident happened and I ran out of time and had to get that computer out of the house.</p>
<p>Well, it's Friday ladies and gentlemen.  I hope you have a good weekend.  I'm going to a party with Lauren on Saturday for one of her friends that got married, so that should be fun.</p>
<p>Stay r33t, j'all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Happy Monday</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/happy-monday-3</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it's Monday.  For whatever reason my alarm didn't go off, but I never sleep late anymore so I woke up without a problem anyway.  Just woke up a little later than I wanted to.  No biggy.
Had a good weekend.  Sat around and watched Joost last night.  It's a great alternative to paying the awful cable company $100 month for Oxygen Network and the Golf Channel.</p>
<p>I'm not allowed to talk about certain people on my blog, but that doesn't mean I can't tell you what's going on in my life.  My second attorney filed a continuance last Wednesday to push off the court date due to the injunction that's still on the record.  I was told that opposing counsel and my attorney couldn't come to an agreement on that injunction and gag order, so they'll have to fight it out in front of a judge later on.  Hence the continuance.  I'll fight this injunction forever if I have to.  This divorce will not be finalized until it's gone.  I hired a specialist attorney who deals with online privacy issues just to fight it, and i'll do more if needed.  Take my life away from me, fine.  But you can't take my freedom of speech online.  So yeah, I was supposed to be divorced by now.  But it doesn't matter to me.  I want to do it right, not do it fast.  I do hope that this resolved quickly for everyone's sake, however.</p>
<p>You may wonder why I'm even in this mess to begin with.  The best I can guess is there might be a claim of "Publication of Private Facts".  Even though nothing I've done has fallen into that, and that's not even what i'm hearing the problem is.  Everything i've ever published is in the public domain, as there was the telling of at least one other person, and therefore making it public.   But again, that's not what the complaint is.  I'm just trying to make sense out of nonsense.</p>
<p>And remember, everyone feel free to comment without fear of anyone going after me for something you said on my blog.  Section 230 of Title 47 of the United States Legal Code protects my rights in that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to get divorced using a mac</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/how-to-get-divorced-using-a-mac</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"What?" You may ask?  "That doesn't make sense!"  Well sure it does.  It's all about how you use your tools, and I used my Mac recently to get divorced.You too can use your Mac to end the tyranny and again regain freedom with your MacBook, Mac Pro, or whatever Apple branded product you may have on hand.  Keep in mind, I do not recommend getting divorced with a PC.  It may not go well.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need an app to help you keep everything organized.  For this I used <a href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/">DevonThink</a>.  Adds native "Print to DevonThink PDF" functionality right into OS X, it will let you edit files of many filetypes, and you're not limited on subfolders like something like Yojimbo is.  This is a pretty hardcore app, but it's become invaluable as a notetaking, filefolder, lifestyle organizer.  Print to PDF all of your emails directly to it, take notes on apartments, and generally drag and drop anything of importance right into it's interface to find later.  It also features smart folders, artificial intelligence to know what files are related to what other files, importing of RSS, and so much more.  This is step one.  A place to put your crap.</li>
<li>Second step, you're going to have to get crap.  Remember that old technology from the 80s or whatever that you never thought you'd need to use again?  Telecopier, or facsimile, or the better known "fax"?  Yeah, you'll have to use it.  Don't feel dirty, it's not your fault.  But you'll need to start getting faxes.  You'll quickly learn that opposing counsel only takes you seriously if you kill a few trees, so you'll have to do so for them to listen to you.  Don't buy a fax machine.  Get a fax number.  Use an online fax service that will email them to you in PDF so you can drop them right into DevonThink.  I used <a href="http://www.trustfax.com/">TrustFax</a>.  It'll let you fax out in any format you want, but you'll mostly be dealing with PDFs.</li>
<li>"How am I going to deal with PDFs?  I hate PDFs!  They're a crappy format." You say.  And you're right.  But you'll deal.  You'll also have to find a way to create them from pieces of paper.  Sorry.  You'll be signing a lot of crap and you'll need a way to get those out either in an email, or fax them with your TrustFax account.  So get one of those <a href="http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/store_access.do?template_type=storefronts&category=all_in_ones&subcat1=color&aoid=22677">HP all-in-one devices </a>to replace whatever inkjet printer you currently have and move on.  They work great with your Mac, and it has native one button scanning functionality.  Throw the paper on the flatbed, push one button, and the PDF will show up in OS X Preview.  Drag that into DevonThink.  PDFs suck, i'm aware.  But this is as good as you'll get.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Apple Mail</a>.  It displays the PDFs natively right in the display of the email, and you won't have to go opening it with anything else.  But make sure you still drag it into DevonThink.  See the pattern here?</li>
<li>Being I'm no good at making any kind of document that looks decent, and if you're not either it's best just to find a format that works and stick with it.  For me it's an outline.  So I love <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">Omni Outliner</a>.  The non-professional copy comes by default on Macs, or at least it did.  If it doesn't anymore, grab a copy.  It rocks.  You'll need to make lists, and this app is made for it.  Open it up and start typing.  I use this app a lot.  When you're done, drag the file into DevonThink.</li>
<li>Get a copy of <a href="http://www.iwascoding.com/GarageSale/">GarageSale</a> for OS X and sell everything you own (minus your Mac) on eBay.  You'll need every cent you can get.</li>
<li>On the same topic of saving money, since you'll have to somehow find the cash to get a new apartment and everything, make sure to "Think Different".  Don't get a phone line, don't get cable television.  All you need is some internet connectivity.  Don't skimp on this, it's your lifeline.  If you need a home phone get <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a>, it's a great service.  It'll email your voicemail directly to you, and Apple Mail will play it natively right in the message.  For TV, get <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a>.  It's free TV.  If that's not enough, buy ala carte from the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/">iTunes Store</a> at $1.99 per show.  A  copy of <a href="http://www.xtorrentp2p.com/">XTorrent</a> will let you subscribe to RSS feeds of tv shows or search torrents for entertainment you want, so that's a worthy investment as well.</li>
<li>I'd highly recommend having a device that can do mobile email.  I love my <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/">Palm Treo</a>.  If you go that route, grab a copy of Markspace's <a href="http://www.markspace.com/">The Missing Sync</a>.  It'll seamlessly sync your mobile world with your Mac and get iCal, Addressbook, Notes and everything else right to your Treo.  There's also a copy for <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">Blackberries</a>, if you're into that.  They're OK too.  But either way, it's good to be connected wherever you are, and have it integrated into your Mac.  You'll get a lot of email and phone calls, so make sure you're prepared to get them all.  (Hint: If you use Vonage you can save your voicemails into DevonThink!)</li>
<li>Change your password on your mac.  Set a different password on your DevonThink database.  I'm serious.  Then do the same on your remote email.</li>
<li>Have a good blogging client, like <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a> or <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, and blog a lot about your experience.  It will make you feel better.  Getting things off your chest is important.  And who knows, someone may want to hear and learn from what you say.</li>

      <title>Looking at art</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/looking-at-art</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So i'm looking at stuff to throw on the walls.  I bookmarked a few things on my apartment list at <a href="http://del.icio.us/gabek/apartment">http://del.icio.us/gabek/apartment</a>.  My favorite is a big black circle for over $260.  It's so pretentious.  I love it.  I'll be that guy.
I have two more Matrix posters to hang, but they're so large, i'm not so sure i'm going to use them.  They're so cool, though.  Maybe i'll put one in my bedroom.</p>
<p>I watched Episode 2 of Heroes last night.  I'm not sure if I like the show yet or not.  It's not gripping.  I could watch episode after episode if I wanted to, but I'm not.  Unlike LOST where when an episode ends you're left hanging and you'd do anything to see the next, with Heroes i'm fine that it's ended and I close the player instead of grabbing the next to see what happens.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Stay r33t.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Perpetual Hosting</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/perpetual-hosting</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's an interesting topic, and one that i've put a lot of thought into.  I'm not going to live forever.  I sure hope not, anyway.  In fact, I may not live until tomorrow.  There's more things that'll kill then will keep things alive.  I may just run into one of them.  If that were to happen, what happens to my stuff?  Does my life online die, like I never existed?  Do I hope one of my friends from #TheCabin jumps in and archives all they can and puts up some kind of lame shrine like for <a href="http://diceman.home.att.net/jason.htm">this guy?</a>
Dave Winer and Nick Bradbury make this comment.  Maybe it's something we should pass along.</p>

<p>This is something I've thought a lot about, too.&nbsp; I'd like this blog to outlive me so that&nbsp;when my kids have grown up,&nbsp;they'll be able to read my old posts to find out more about me.&nbsp; Maybe they'd enjoy some of my <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2007/02/holy_rush.html">goofy</a> <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2006/10/crazy_poopin_bi.html">stories</a>.&nbsp; Or perhaps they'd appreciate forward-looking technical posts like <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/ramblings_on_go.html">this one</a>.&nbsp; And I'm sure they'd like to read <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2007/02/my_hannah.html">about</a> <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2006/10/hit_and_run.html">themselves</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Right now, though, I have no guarantee that this can happen.&nbsp; How can I be sure that what I write today can still be read by my children many years from now?</p>

      <title>Sick</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/sick-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Argh.  I hate when I get sick, it never goes away.  I got sick this weekend and it'll be here to stay for a while.  It's the standard "i think it's a cold" but really I know it's a sinus infection, because that's what I get.  It's a sore throat because of all the crap falling from my sinuses as a post-nasal drip, and when I blow my nose I get equal part nose crap and blood crap.  Yes, it's a sinus infection.  If I make myself go to the doctor and get antibiotics it will go away.  If I don't, it will stay... indefinitely, until I go to the doctor.
In other news, at noon Central time Steve Jobs will kick off this years WWDC with a bang as usual with his Stevenote and tell us what we all need.  Some things to look for.</p>

      <title>Status on my album, or whatever</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/status-on-my-album-or-whatever</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So i've pretty much had the freedom now for over a month to work on my music whenever I want to.  There's a problem though, an a rather large one.  I don't want to.  There's just too much going on, and i'm unable to focus on a large project like that at the present time.  It's really bothering me.
I mean, there's no timeline, so there's really no problem.  It's my own thing, and there's nobody chomping at the bit to listen to this stuff.  But I think it's good, and I really want people to hear it, I just can't get myself to finish it.  I'm a really different place now than I was not so long ago in so many ways, and it's really difficult to try to force yourself back into that mindset.</p>
<p>I don't know, I know breaks from this stuff is good from me.  History has shown me that when I leave my music for a duration of time I come back to it with a clear head and I look at it differently.  Generally when you work on anything for a long time you start caring about the details and not the big picture.  And that's always true in projects i'm involved in.</p>
<p>So hopefully soon I can figure out what it takes to get back in front of that desk and finish this stuff.  There's so much to come i'm really excited about.</p>

      <title>The World of Stupid Man, the Comic Book</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/06/stupid-man-the-comic-book-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I came across an archive of little comics I made in 6th grade.  These are surrounded around the character "Stupid Man" and his friends.  I'll post a new one every once and a while.  So to start things up is Stupid Man #1.

      <title>AIM high</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/07/aim-high</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So long story short, like 7 months ago I changed the password on my AIM screen name in order to do some testing of code I was working on.  I never changed the password back, and my client somehow forgot what the password was.  As did I.
I couldn't get the stupid "reset password" thing to work on aim.com, so I figured now was as good of a time as any just to sign up a new name again.  My buddy lists get so long and crapped up with random people every 4 years or so it's good just to start over anyway.</p>
<p>So go ahead and throw "TheGabeKangas" on your buddy list.</p>
<p>Of course, after I decided to create that name I did a grep through some old apache logs and saw that password I forgot in a HTTP GET request for that code I was working on.  So whatever, i'll keep both of them logged in :)</p>
<p>Had to go into work tonight.  It kinda sucks having to make that extra trip there, but what needs to be done needs to be done.</p>
<p>Ok, off to bed.  I really need my sleep.  But a wise man once said "You can sleep when you're dead."  Oh wait, that was MDFMK i'm thinking of.  Oh well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Cool my phone thing works</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/07/cool-my-phone-thing-works</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I spent yesterday playing more with Asterisk PBX and I have a pretty neat system working.  I could add all kinds of features now.  So far I have voicemails being emailed to me working, custom menus, call forwarding to my fax line, cell phone and any other numbers.  If it's a certain date/time/whatever I can make it go right to voicemail and not ring any phones, or just go right to a different line.  I need to figure out TTS stuff still, not sure why that seems to be broke.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Happy Day Off / General personal update</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/07/happy-day-off-general-personal-update</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The whole America rah-rah thing isn't my bag, so I celebrate this holiday for what it really is.  A day off.
So one of my favorite guys at work, my uber-manager, Khyle is leaving.  It sucks.  He's an awesome guy, an outstanding manager and i'm worried about the atmosphere once he's gone.</p>
<p>I've got a new title in the company, I guess I never posted about that.  "Senior Systems Administrator, West Notifications Group".  I've been a full time employee for a few months now after leaving Oronova.  All in all it's a good gig.  A lot has changed with the acquisition but I generally get to stay out of a lot of it.  I'm just on a lot more conference calls now.  I'm worried with Khyle leaving the lameness will kick up a notch, along with Eric's ego, and it will become one very sad place.  But at the moment, I really enjoy being an employee of West.  I think I fit in with the group there more than any other place i've ever been at, and i'm honestly appreciated also for the first time.  With all the good things personally about the job it's too bad to see all the little bad things slip through the cracks.  But all in all i'm positive.</p>
<p>Positive you say?  Where did that come from?  I know, i'm generally the least positive person on earth and you may wonder where this silver lining came from.  An orange bottle.  That's right, i'm a certified nut, and I couldn't be happier about it.</p>
<p>I've been on Lexapro for a few months now and my friends, it really is a miracle drug.  I don't want to sit here and make 100 posts about drugs i'm on, but this has really been a game changer for me.  I'm really enjoying my life for the first time ever.  The small stresses and annoyances are no longer enough for me to want to jump off a bridge.  I'm making friends, i'm going out, and i'm having a good time.  All things I haven't done probably since high school.  </p>
<p>Sure, the world sucks.  But if you find a way to filter the crap and enjoy the things worth enjoying, then maybe it's a place worth living in after-all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Uncle Art had his share of struggles with emotional serenity all his life never know if lithium really was the right drug or not.
I really didn't like 4th landing middle week.  Sure a day off but now two days work needed to be done today and still more tomorrow and it feels like the week should have been over by now.</p>

      <title>Important by default</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/07/important-by-default</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don't you hate when people make themselves look important by holding everything back from everyone else?
That's how things are at work now.  My "manager" right now is the only person from my team involved in a huge production issue, and he won't let me be involved.  I was hired here to work on issues like this, but he wants to look important by being known as the only person that can do things, and being the only person who did do things.</p>
<p>For large scale issues it should be all hands on deck, everyone working on things.  But when you pipe in he tells you how wrong you are and to quiet down.  Seriously, he does that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/?p=352">See my March 28th post on this same topic</a>.  It's only gotten worse.  And it will continue to as long as he's here.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lauren thought I was crazy for getting that big of a piercing right off the bat.  But there's nothing as invigorating as a big needle ripping through flesh to feel alive.  I guess it could also make you feel like you're dying.  But whatever.  I think it's cool.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He has his left ear gaged as well, and has started his own comic strip (last year - 6th grade)!! "Kangas" gene running wild.  To take this one step further, I call him the "music machine".  Trumpet, trombone, bartione, drums, harmonica, and electric guitar. 
The two of you should communicate more - AMAZING!!</p>

      <title>Phone nerd</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/07/phone-nerd</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven't done a little project for a while.  I've been slacking.  So I started one last night.
I realized I never use my Vonage line.  At all.  It's really a complete waste of money.  I used 0 min out of 500 last month.  How very sad.  Even though I like the features, I never use it.</p>
<p>So yesterday I decided to read up and learn about Asterisk, an open-source software PBX system.  I signed up to a Voip provider and got a local number.  When that number is dialed the provider makes a SIP call to my PBX and the call is answered over IP.  Once Asterisk answers that call I can do anything I want.  Forward to my cell, have a menu, voicemail, etc.</p>
<p>At this point i've got Asterisk to actually answer the call, so that's a win.  I've also been able to leave a voicemail for an extension.  Now I have to learn about forwarding calls elsewhere.</p>

<p>Saw Rasputina at The Abby last night.  Was a good show.  The set list was better the first time I saw them, but we had a good time anyway.  They rocked out and everyone enjoyed it.  I'm tired today, though.  Out late, up early, and i'll be out late tonight too because of work.</p>
<p>Next stop, <a href="http://pitchforkmusicfestival.com/">The Pitchfork Music Festival</a> to see The New Pornographers and Of Montreal this Sunday.</p>

      <title>Should I create a work category?</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/07/should-i-create-a-work-category</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I might need it.
So I was made aware yesterday by "manager" that they planned on deploying the big platform update this weekend.  This weekend.  Lollapalooza.  They scheduled this without asking me, without inviting me to any planning meetings.  Nothing.</p>
<p>I missed Friday last year of Lollapalooza because of work.  I refuse to miss it this year.  If they want to deploy it this weekend, have fun.  In fact, a document I saw said that i'm not even required to be there.  I know that's not true, but they just don't care enough to write my name down.  It's only Eric this, Eric that.  Eric does everything.  Fuck Eric.  I take no responsibility for this place as long as i'm ignored.  I'm going to Lollapalooza and i'm not showing up for anything that I'm not given a say in.</p>
<p>They require my skills, but they don't require me.  Funny.</p>
<p>This place has been awful ever since ex-uber-manager got promoted, and now even worse since he left.  I was respected so much by him when he was my direct manager, and now it's like i'm not even here.  I used to get invited to meetings and have input in how things are done.  Now if I didn't show up i'm not sure anyone would notice.</p>
<p>I'll give it some time, i'm not sure how much.  But I won't deal with this forever, as I don't see it getting any better.</p>
<p>They'll be sorry if i'm not here and then Eric leaves when his wife drops a baby in however many months.  But that's how it'll be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I should go to bed, but I thought i'd post quick.  It was an awesome weekend.  Photos are up from Lauren, Mary and I going to Kinetic Playground Saturday night.  And Mary and I went to The PItchfork Music Festival today.
Now I have to try and pretend to be normal again and go back to work in the morning :P</p>

      <title>Worst.  Manager.  Ever.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/07/worst-manager-ever</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I seriously cannot stand "working for" this guy.  We have a huge update to our environment going live and he *just told me* that we're doing it tomorrow at midnight.  WTF.  That's something I should had known weeks ago.
I ask him questions and he won't give me answers.  Like "And what's the game plan, what's the timeline?" and he just says "you know what it is".  No I don't.  He hordes information like crazy.  He won't tell me anything.</p>
<p>If this continues i'm gone.  Without Khyle here there's no sensible management, and I cannot stand Eric.</p>
<p>It pisses me off like no other when someone refuses to share information to make himself look and feel important.  Go to all the meetings, not forward emails, and then say "ok... do it."  Do what?</p>
<p>He needs his ass kicked.  And I want Khyle back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Car situation</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/08/car-situation</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a few options.</p>
<p>Option 1) Refinance and keep the Scion. It turns out that's a very difficult option, because anyone that refinances also wants both names on the original loan to stay on the refinanced one. So that sucked.</p>
<p>2) Trade in my Scion and get a new car in order to start clean.</p>
<p>3) Drop the Scion off in Kelley's driveway, since it's just as much hers as it is mine and have her deal with it.</p>
<p>Most people found option #3 to make the most sense. I agreed. However, I figured i'd take the high road and save her some money from having to contact her attorney again. I had enough fun with that the first time. Wait, she's quite wealthy now after her windfall. Damn. I missed out on some potential fun!</p>
<p>Oh well. So the last remaining option was to grab a new car. So I did. 2007 Chevy Aveo. It has an Aux in jack for my iPod, and that's probably the best feature. Oh, that and it has two aux power jacks, and the Scion only had one. That means I can plug more crap in. That's important.</p>
<p>See below for photo of the model. Mine is in black.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Nice wheels Gabe.  I like that one better than the Scion and something tells me it will be more comfortable.  Although, I would have loved to have seen you drop that car off in Kelley's driveway.  There wouldn't have a been a god damn thing should have done legally.  She can raise hell to her attorneys but the law is if you're the co-signor you are a guarantor.  I sue these people everyday who think they can't get in trouble bc they are only the codebtor.  Wrong again?  I take everything the have, their house, their property, garnish their wages, freeze their bank accounts.  You wouldn't believe the options I have at my disposal.
But, anyway you need to take us all for a ride in this car.  We need to find a show to go to soon or something.  </p>
<p>Later.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Crap with my car</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/08/crap-with-my-car</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I thought I had the crap with my car dealt with, as Kelley is demanding to be removed from my auto loan. Now I just got an email:</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we cannot refinance for you based on the information you provided because you applied by yourself and we cannot remove anyone from loans or titles. In other words, the names that are on your current loan/lease now are the names it must stay in for us to do the refinance."</p>
<p>Wtf! I thought that was the point of a refinance is to get evil ex-wives off your loan. I thought this was going to be taken care of.</p>
<p>Guess she'll be taking me to court. But it's not my fault it's not legally possible to do what she wants done.</p>
<p>I hate her with the fire of one hundred dragons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Happy Weekend</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/08/happy-weekend</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I told myself two weeks ago this weekend would be dedicated to getting my butt in gear and sitting down in front of the console and starting where I left off with my album.  I don't know, though.  We'll see.  I really have to clean my apartment and do laundry first.  But even if this weekend isn't the weekend that I get back on track the good news is that I WANT to.  Finally.  I want to get to work again, and that's a nice feeling.  It's been a long time since I cared.  I'm excited.  I can't wait to share my work with everyone.
My goal is to have the album finished in time for some kind of Lazer Day celebration in November.  I seriously don't think that's possible.  But all I can do is try, right?</p>
<p>Laundry laundry laundry.  It's been a couple weeks since I performed this task.</p>
<p>This !!! (chk chk chk) album is good.</p>
<p><strong>Must Be The Moon</strong> from the album "Myth Takes" by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=chkchkchk">!!!</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Odd dreams</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/08/odd-dreams</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So i've had two dreams recently about me getting fired from my job. Last nights was even more disturbing.</p>
<p>It included our new uber-manager from Omaha yelling at me on the phone and then bringing my case to some peer review committee to see if I should be able to keep my job or not. He said "the choice was clear" and I could no longer work for the company.</p>
<p>The one before that was with my "manager" firing me. But whatever. If he fired me i'd probably just ignore him and still come back the next day.</p>
<p>So I decided on my next tattoo. It'll be this, but in black.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Gabe,Cool choice - you are where it's AT. </p>
<p>Sounds more like nightmares - had an aweful one myself last eve - exhusband back in Ishpeming - was living in the old apartment on Cleveland Ave where we did years ago (you know the big blue building across from Pioneer Square) anyway, he was stalking me.  Got into the place while I was at work.  Hid in a closet til I came home - the chase scene... with adrenaline flowing I grabbed his wrist - breaking it.  Lot of good that did - now he can't work and is even more irate - now it's the running away through the downtown streets of Ishpeming down Main over on Pearl in the alleys finding refuge somewhere that I was not familiar with - WOKE UP.  One of those wake up, wake up, please wake up moments.  Suppose I should stop watching Law &amp; Order CI just before bed.  Oh well, thankfully only a dream.</p>
<p>Dan and I are going for more tattoos in November sometime after he turns 18.  Well, back to the real world of work.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>The Best Survey Ever</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/08/the-best-survey-ever</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font: 12px Helvetica;">(Reposted from something I posted on MySpace)</p>
<p style="font: 12px Helvetica;">I never do surveys. But I thought now would be a good time.</p>
<p style="font: 12px Helvetica;">However, this one has got to be good. Nay, not good. This has to be the best survey ever.</p>
<p style="font: 12px Helvetica;">Do you want to know what shirt I'm wearing right now? The last person I talked to on the phone? Current crush? My favorite color? The age I was first kissed?</p>
<p style="font: 12px Helvetica;">Then, friends, dig through your "Forwards" folder. Look at bulletins your friends have completed. Did it make you chuckle, cry, or jump and say "Wow!"? Then send it along to me. Maybe i'll take bits and pieces from each. Maybe i'll just chose one. Maybe i'll be completely disappointed with what you send me and end up doing absolutely nothing.</p>
<p style="font: 12px Helvetica;">You can help me on this mission. The best survey ever. Can it be done?</p>

      <title>Why haven't I posted?</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/08/why-havent-i-posted</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I haven't posted since Lollapalooza.  If you didn't see the photos, you may not have even known I had gone at this point.
I'll make that rundown quick.  Daft Punk was a life changing, unbelievable experience.  It was the show of shows.  Read any review of lolla for Friday and you'll only hear the same thing over and over.  Amazing.</p>
<p>!!! on Sunday took 2nd place in putting on a great show.  I really liked hearing the new tunes, including Heart of Hearts, and seeing the new vocal addition to the band.  They put on a really powerful performance and had the crowd drawn in the whole time.</p>
<p>I missed half of Ghostland Obvservatory's set on Friday due to showing up a bit late, but they put on the same show as always.  I really like them.  Hope to see them again soon.  Powerful, danceable tunes.</p>
<p>LCD Soundsystem, after me talking about them non-stop for like two+ years I finally saw.  And to be honest, kind of a let down.  Not all they are cracked up to be live.  And that's ok.  They come off as a really good rock band with some synth's in person.  They lose some of the energy in person, but I was still really happy to finally see them.</p>
<p>Also saw Satellite Party, who put on a good set with Perry singing Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros cover songs mixed in with their originals.  Sound Tribe Sector 9, who sounds like a MIDI file.  CSS didn't show due to a missed flight, that really sucked.  Cold War Kids, who I knew would be a snooze... were a snooze.  M.I.A. can rock a house.  Patti Smith, even though she's like 100 can still be pissed and sing songs about it to a lot of people who want to hear her.  It was a good set, and I'm glad I got to see her.  Interpol put on a really clean show.  It was nothing special, but the music was good and as a crowd we were into it.  Amy Winehouse, I really didn't like.  But I knew I wouldn't.  And I mixed in watching sets of Modest Mouse, My Morning Jacket, Flosstradamus, Apostle of Hustle, TV on the Radio... and many more.</p>
<p>I didn't see Pearl Jam.  After three days, and everyone wanting to go see one single band all at once at the end of it all, I just wasn't interested.  If you were there you really wouldn't blame me.</p>
<p>I was going to post about other things other than Lollapalooza too, but I think this is enough for right now.  Maybe later?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Ahh, the weekend</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/09/ahh-the-weekend</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the weekend is soon upon us. And i'm glad to see it. It's been a really long week.</p>
<p>My parents invited me up to see them this weekend, but i'm just too tired. Not to mention I should be doing laundry and cleaning my apartment, all that fun stuff. But mostly I'm just exhausted to go anywhere and do much.</p>
<p>I got paid today, so I went grocery shopping. Spent about $100 in food, so that's good. When I have food that means i'm not going out to get it elsewhere and hopefully i'll end up saving money. I got a lot of pizza products. I love pizza.</p>
<p>There's this cat I see sometimes when I come home from work. It sits in the parking lot and watches me come in. Anytime I try and get close it runs away. I wanted to give it something today, but I didn't know what. On TV they always give cats bowls of milk, so I did that. I'll see tomorrow if it came to have any. I'd totally bring in the cat if I could get to it, but it always runs away when I get close. It just likes to watch from afar and then hide in the woods.</p>
<p>I watched the 1986 Transformers movie tonight. It's pretty funny, but good. Watched The Wizard last night. The one about Nintendo games. Actually, i've been watching a ton of movies lately. Sometimes two a night. I'm pretty lame.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Good day (I hope)</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/09/good-day-i-hope</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is our company outing. We're getting lunch, going on a boat cruise on the Chicago River, and then food and drinks at a bar &amp; grill. As long as nothing breaks before noon, we'll actually be able to go this time. Last time was cancelled due to production issues we had to tend to.</p>
<p>So who else saw that <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/s83522y/event/index.html?internal=g4h5jl83a">Apple announcement</a> yesterday? Everyone, right? Man oh man oh man. That iPod touch will be mine. Multitouch, wifi, Safari??? It's more than I ever expected from the rumored touch screen iPod. If not the iPod touch i'd love to also get an iPod Fatty (nano), or the updated Classic. My iPod is a G4 iPod Photo, and i've been waiting for this day to refresh it. But i'll have to save up a few bucks in order to do that. An exciting few months for my precious Apple. iPhone, new iPods and next month OS X 10.5, Leopard. I'm really looking forward to Leopard probably more than anything else.</p>
<p>Another great moment that should take place today is ekpneo getting his Treo! Wohoo! I shipped him the Treo 700p that the ex gave me when we got divorced. I certainly don't want it, and it's not worth selling it, as used phones are worth $0. So this is really the best of both worlds, I don't have to hold on to it, he gets to have it. He'll be able to IRC from anywhere now, and i'm excited for him.</p>
<p>Hope the rest of the week is quiet for everyone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2007/09/my-blog-has-been-broke-sorry-and-other-stuff</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So my blog front page has been broken. The actual blog wasn't, and still isn't. But my custom RSS aggregator page that has been working flawlessly for years now suddenly isn't. I don't get it. Whatever, i'll fix it at some point. For now, though, it's just going to be redirected to the weblog page. Now you can read. Happy days!</p>
<p>Got tickets for *another* Birthday Massacre show coming up at the Abbey! Wohoo. Going to drag MaryBeth with me again like for the house of blues show.</p>
<p>It's been fun talking and hanging out with MaryBeth lately. I haven't seen her for a long time. We were in high school together, she was a senior and I a Freshman. Then I saw her sometimes when I first met Marianne. A few weeks ago I was looking through an old saved buddy list file of mine and saw her screen name on it.</p>
<p>I'm starting to feel better since i've been taking my antibiotics I got last week. 10 day supply, so i'll be in good shape. Not to mention I got my crazy pills. My crazy doc tried to break it to me gently that i'll need to be on them the rest of my life and I said "well, yeah. I could have told you that."</p>
<p>Work is.. eh. Work. Good days, bad days. Bad days are always due to the same crap. Me being ignored. Me being left out of knowing things. Khyle mentioned the other day on IM how important it is for the company for me to stay here. He's probably right, but I just don't like working with Eric. That's really the bottom line.</p>
<p>Hope all is well with all of you. It feels like a Friday today. Too bad it's not.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>One of those days</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/09/one-of-those-days</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is one of those days that I just want to blow my fucking brains out. I haven't had many of those days in the recent past. Maybe it's because i've been out of my antidepz and my fucking doctor won't let me have a refill.</p>
<p>Seriously I don't know what the hell is going on. I realize i'm completely shitty at making friends and keeping them and I don't know why. I trust that things are fine and then boom. I get yelled at for something, or they just disappear or whatever. This would be completely understandable if it wasn't for the fact that I think i'm a pretty cool person to hang out with now. I wasn't before, but this is now. And now still seems to suck ass.</p>
<p>I'm sick of my job. I'm sick of my money problems. I'm sick of being the divorced loser while everyone else in the world is having the time of their lives. Fuck that.</p>
<p>Someone put me out of my misery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Dude, you need your meds.  You need to get another doctor, you're not EVER supposed to just stop taking an anti-depressant cold turkey.  It can be dangerous, and I know from experience it will make you feel like shit and like you wanna set fire to the whole fucking world.
Geez. We need to hang out soon.  I'm on the Bright Eyes tix, I have a Chicago Theatre connection that will hopefully mean I can get in on a presale.  </p>
<p>So, pick a movie and let's go.......Just give me a call.  I wanna see the new wheels.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I sent an email that i'm not going into work Monday. I'm just feeling too lousy. If i'm not feeling better i'll go to the local clinic and get some drugs to fight this off. It seems like I was just sick, but here I am again feeling the same. Oh well.</p>
<p>Because i've slept so much this weekend it's after midnight now and i'm not really all that tired. I guess i'll read for a bit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote cite="http://www.music2dot0.com/archives/36"><p>As for the special situation in China, it does not seem to be easy to obtain Western music via legal channels, so I have the following suggestion for our fans: If you can find and buy our legal CDs, I express my thanks for your support. If you cannot find it, I think that downloading from the Internet is a more acceptable option than buying pirated CDs. Our music is easy to find on the Internet, and you might not need to spend much effort to find most of our songs. If you like our songs after you’ve heard them, please feel free to share it with your friends. As I have put all my effort and heart into my music, I sincerely hope that more and more people can share the enjoyment with us.</p></blockquote>

      <title>What a day</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/09/what-a-day</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a sad day today. All in all I like most of the people I work with in my office. A few exceptions, and once i've mentioned before. But all in all, I think most everyone are good people and pretty smart.</p>
<p>By around 10am this morning I hated them all.</p>
<p>It was upsetting I was letting everyone get to me. But I'm not a people person. I like to sit in my cube with my nose to the monitor and get things done alone. I don't like talking to people. But from the second I walked in this morning at 7am it was my personal hell. I just can't deal with it. If I was on my meds I probably would have dealt with it better, but I wasn't doing well at all.</p>
<p>And Eric spent most of the day at his desk, too busy to stand up and help because he's just that much more important than Joe and I.</p>
<p>But yeah, it was a really bad day at work today. Everyone yelling at everyone else. Everyone blaming everyone for everything. Nothing working, and everyone claiming themselves as highest priority for any number of reasons. I seriously wanted to hurt them all. Hurt them badly. I hate when people feel they're better than everyone else and try to pull shit. "Well I have a meeting", "well I really need to get this to", "well i'm probably the most important to get working right now because". It's terrible. The corporate environment brings out the worst in people, and that brings out the worst in me. And bringing out the worst in me brings out people getting thrown down the stairs.</p>
<p>On the bright note, after a few phone calls I got my doctor to call in a script for my meds. I'll be picking them up in the morning. This circus should soon come to an end.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Well I sure do hope you have a better day ahead - cant believe the Doc made you wait on the refill.  Hyphen is definitely right on - dont mess with missing doses etc.  Mike had some similar incidents - good thing it was only the wall and a chair that got damaged in the process.
I may have messed up your blog yesterday, did try to leave a reply then but it never updated - sorry if it was.  Fingers moved faster than the mind I am guessing.</p>
<p>Here for a sounding board anytime you need it man.</p>
<p>Enjoy your week end..........</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <link>/blog/2007/10/hello-from-marquette-michigan</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I made it up to the UP in one piece. My car didn't disappear or anything. I have about 30min or so until I have to be at my aunt's for my grandparent's 60th anniversary party. But I decided to drive around and see if I could find somewhere with wifi.</p>
<p>I found a Starbucks and knew that would be a good start.</p>
<p>I walk in, "Excuse me, do you have wifi?" they respond "Yes we do. Well, we don't, but someone else around here does. And the signal reaches in here."</p>
<p>Good enough for me.</p>
<p>So I know where to go if I have time later to get back online. I miss the internet. My treo desn't even work up here :(</p>
<p>Ok, talk to everyone later</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So i'm not going to go too deep into the story right now. But my car has been towed by the city of Chicago because someone stole the license plate off it, and my iPod is missing from it. I'm the victim of a crime and was ticketed $500 for it. I have to pay that before I can get my car back. Details to come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My poor, poor car</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/10/my-poor-poor-car</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Man, things are bad. Real bad.</p>
<p>So like my last post said, my car got towed, and I wasn't sure exactly why. Something to do with my temporary license plate on it. There's two options: 1) The plate was stolen and the car was ticketed and towed due to having no plate on the car. Or 2) There was an incorrect plate on the car, registered to someone else, and when a cop looked it up had the car towed because it was wrong and possibly stolen.</p>
<p>Upon going to the city of chicago car pound last night I received this piece of paperwork stating what the problem was.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/sc00967094.jpg"><img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/sc00967094-tm.jpg" width="278" height="100"/></a></p>
<p>It says I owe $500 for an "altered plate". They described altered plate as a date was changed, or I have a plate registered to another car. When I went to check out my car, the plate wasn't on there at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Photo_100407_003.jpg"><img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Photo_100407_003-tm.jpg" width="133" height="100"/></a></p>
<p>Altered plate, but it wasn't there at all.</p>
<p>So today I talked to a really nice officer who looked up my car, and saw my plate number (that i called my dealership to get) wasn't in the system for an altered plate, she couldn't find my plate number at all. Had to find it via VIN. She said the plate was confiscated by the police when it was towed. So that seems like a valid answer. Except, when I went back to my car to get the ticket the ticket doesn't say it was an altered plate at all. In fact, the ticket says I got ticketed for "missing plate", and I owe $50.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/sc0096328e.jpg"><img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/sc0096328e-tm.jpg" width="40" height="100"/></a></p>
<p>How can I get told two completely different answers? One says my plate was missing, and that's why it was ticketed.. but not towed. Another says it was towed because I had a plate and it was incorrect.</p>
<p>To make it worse when I got to my car to get the ticket, the driver's side window was smashed in. Last night when I was there it wasn't. Now my window is totaled. So not only do I not have my car, it's being attacked while impounded.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Photo_100407_001.jpg"><img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Photo_100407_001-tm.jpg" width="133" height="100"/></a><a href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Photo_100407_002.jpg"><img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Photo_100407_002-tm.jpg" width="133" height="100"/></a></p>
<p>So I got the information off the ticket who called in my car and ticketed it originally. The nice police officer who helped me out on the phone gave me the actual name of the person who called it in, and said I can call them at 10 pm tonight when they start and I can ask any questions I have.</p>
<p>We'll see how that goes. This is not going well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Nine Inch Nails is no longer with a record label</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/10/nine-inch-nails-is-no-longer-with-a-record-label</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/46231-reznor-hammers-another-nail-in-the-industrys-coffin">How awesome is this.</a> I knew the time was coming, and i'm glad for everyone that it's here. NIN without limitations. Sweet.</p>
<p>"Hello everyone. I've waited a LONG time to be able to make the following announcement: as of right now Nine Inch Nails is a totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label. I have been under recording contracts for 18 years and have watched the business radically mutate from one thing to something inherently very different and it gives me great pleasure to be able to finally have a direct relationship with the audience as I see fit and appropriate.</p>
<p>Look for some announcements in the near future regarding 2008.</p>
<p>Exciting times, indeed."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Peanut Butter Solution</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/10/the-peanut-butter-solution</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/200710071109.jpg" width="275" height="412" /></p>
<p>Where to begin. I remember watching this movie as a kid. And by "remember" I remember vaguely very little about the movie other then how I felt about the movie. For years I thought I made up the movie. I didn't really remember the plot. All I remembered was a terrifying movie that troubled me deeply as a child and always stayed with me as I got older. For a while I figured it was a dream I had as a kid and that's why I don't really remember it, but just know it was messed up, as many dreams are.</p>
<p>After some time on Google, a while ago I figured i'd give it a shot and do some queries. Something about peanut butter, and hair, and a movie. And eventually I came to my answer. This troubling item of my past was real. And it's called The Peanut Butter Solution.</p>
<p>You think i'm crazy, don't you? I'm not. Look at these quotes from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2Cm4Cy3rxs">YouTube page</a> with it's trailer. <span style="font-style: italic;">"<span style="font-style: normal;">This movie used to creep me out when I was only 4 or 5. I'm 23 now and just watching the trailer brings back horrible memories!", "I was like 4 years old when I used to watch this movie..I used to be shit scared back then..I never got over it, been looking for it for years", "The trailer makes it sound like such a light-hearted, non-nightmare-causing film...But we know better.", "yea this movie destroyed me whe i was a primary school! ahhhhh! so cool people still remember it! it must have realy scared our inocent minds!"... and on and on and on. I'm not the only one.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcPUX7OMW-A&amp;mode=related&amp;search=">By comparison check out the Canadian trailer of the exact same movie.</a></p>
<p>I mentioned the movie to Steph in #TheCabin asking if she's seen it. She's uber-canadian so I figured if anyone has, she would. And she did. And she freaked. "&lt;^_^bean&gt; i have had nightmares of that movie since I first saw it in third grade".</p>
<p>I somehow feel better about it all after reading what others have had to say, and talking to Steph about it. It's closure. Or as close as possible, anyway. It'll never leave any of us.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>From me.  To you.  My blog.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/11/untitled-1-3</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello friends.</p>
<p>I've been quiet lately. And for that, I apologize. Not a ton has been going on, but enough.</p>
<p>Work has been really busy lately. I've become what people like to call "important" due to all the projects going on, and my knowledge on the subjects required. Lots and lots of meetings. More than I'd like. I have more work on my plate than I can sometimes handle, but i'm totally cranking through things. I'll be a rockstar if I can come through with everything.</p>
<p>I've been working on music again the past couple weeks. And as a lazer day gift (was on the 7th) I gave everyone three of my new songs. <a href="http://www.real-ity.com/dropbox/lazerdaygift">Feel free to go listen to them yourself</a>. I hope you like them. More to come soon. Can't wait for everyone to get their hands on the new album.</p>
<p>On a whim last week I met up with Dawn, who marched in the Kilties with me, and was also in the Americanos after I marched there. We've talked over IM plenty over the 4 or so years we've known each other, but never met up at any point. She told me that she was moving from IL back to Michigan soon, so if we were going to go hang out we had to do it soon. So last Saturday we made plans to go out that night. I must say, we had an amazing time. I had no idea we had so much in common when it comes to music, technology, computers. She's a geek. How about that? I had no idea we'd hit it off, but we did. She's moving a couple hours away, but we certainly want to see each other again soon.</p>
<p>Hope all is well with everyone else, and hope everyone had a great lazer day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Who I should vote for</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/11/who-i-should-vote-for</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I listened to Net@Nite the other day and heard about a new site called <a href="http://www.connect2elect.com">Connect2Elect</a>.  It allows you to rate what is important to you as far as views, and it'll rank what candidates match you.
You put all your views, in order of importance, and this is what I ended up with.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.real-ity.com/dropbox/ZZ7B324F17.jpg"></center></p>
<p>Now it may be a bit misleading, as some of the things I ranked as #1 in importance aren't "core issues" of the election.  So to vote purely on an issue that is much less important globally, but something I feel strongly for is probably a mistake.  Regardless I urge each of you to check out the site and see what comes up.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Wild dream last night</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/11/wild-dream-last-night</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I had a dream last night. Really odd one.</p>
<p>I dreamt that I had some control over a robot. Like a big, crazy, Voltronesque robot. But nobody knew about it, even though it was huge. And I controlled it via a unix shell.</p>
<p>There was someone, and i'm not sure who.. or why, but I wanted them dead. And I found out they were flying on a plane. So I told my robot to grab the plane (with it's hands. yes, the robot is that big), and throw the plane into space. Everyone on the plane died. Then I turned myself into the police.</p>
<p>The police were happy to see me turn myself in for the death of the one person I admitted to, but I never admitted to the rest of the people who died on the plane, nor would I explain that I had a robot, or how I did it.</p>
<p>It was at this point in the story I realized I had something I needed to finish at work. So the cops drove me to work and sat by my desk as I finished up a few things before they escorted me directly to prison. No trial, no courts. Directly to jail.</p>
<p>And in my cell is where my dream ended.</p>
<p>Crazy, eh?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Gabe's 2007 Review of Stuff</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/12/gabes-2007-review-of-stuff</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I do this every year. This one is a bit smaller than previous ones, and I try not to duplicate too much from things I've already talked about. Regardless, here is my review of things and stuff involved with me in 2007. I'd love to go through and hyperlink all these things for you, but it's really a lot of work, and I'm lazy. So if you're at all interested, and you probably aren't, just go ahead and google it.</p>
<p><span style="font: 13.0px AppleGothic; color: #555555">▼</span> OS X Software</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 30.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #545454">I've come across a ton of great apps this year that run on my Mac.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 30.0px; text-indent: -30.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"><span style="font: 13.0px AppleGothic; color: #555555">▼</span> MoodBlast</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 48.0px; text-indent: -48.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"><span style="font: 13.0px Helvetica">•</span> This lets me update statuses on Facebook, Twitter, Jaiku, Aidum and Tumblr all at once. It's also scriptable. So I wrote an applescript that's triggered by <b>MarcoPolo</b> to auto update when I move around to/from work.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 30.0px; text-indent: -30.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"><span style="font: 13.0px AppleGothic; color: #555555">▼</span> Hazel</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 48.0px; text-indent: -48.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"><span style="font: 13.0px Helvetica">•</span> My theory on the desktop for myself was "if you can't use it responsibly, you can't use it at all." So I don't. I've disabled icons on my OS X desktop completely. However the folder named "Desktop" is still my dropbox for all my crap. Let me introduce you to Hazel. I create rules and hazel moves stuff around for me. Sorts them into subfolders, adds to iPhoto or iTunes, deletes old files, archives to an external drive.. anything I want. This makes my life sooo much easier to find stuff. If I just downloaded a video I know exactly where to find it because I know Hazel will move it there.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 48.0px; text-indent: -48.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"><span style="font: 13.0px Helvetica">•</span> For instance, here's a shot of my Documents folder. How clean!</p>

It let me keep everything all password protected in a database that I could search through at any time. Worked great with all the pdfs I had to deal with.</p>

Helps keep them all organized. The addition of "Events" in iLife '08 is really nice.</p>

When I'm at work it changes my screensaver timeout to 5min and kicks off other things I request of it. When I get home it sets my timeout to 60min, starts up my torrent apps, etc.</p>

It's faster and easier than dealing with torrents, but they don't have everything. It usually works like so: if it's the day of airing, i'll get it via torrents. It's brand new and it should download quick. If I can't find it on torrents, i'll get it on iTunes, or if I can't get it fast enough via a torrent it's off to iTunes. Often times I just don't feel like playing the torrent game and i'll get it from iTunes right when I see it up.</p>

      <title>Hello weekend</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/12/hello-weekend</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello bloggy blog. I haven't really had a lot of time to post an update lately. But I always say that, and so do most people with blogs.</p>
<p>This is the first weekend in a while where i'm at home. I've been spending a lot of time off doing stuff. Last weekend, believe it or not, I was in Racine for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilties_Drum_and_Bugle_Corps">Kilties</a> banquet. Dawn invited me to go with her, and I used the opportunity to donate my uniform back to the corps. It's been sitting in my closet since 2004 when I last marched. But time heals and I think things between me and the corps are much better now.</p>
<p>Being at their rehearsal on Sunday made me really want to march again. It's so easy when there to think that's something I should do. Everyone telling you that you should march, and seeing everyone with their instruments. At more than one point I almost caved and signed up. But I know with my job it's not a good idea, and I really would be giving up all this freedom that i've come to enjoy these past months. I still need to do my own thing before I agree to be part of someone else's larger vision. It would be great to be under the direction of <a href="http://www.dci.org/about/fame/view_member.cfm?member_id=4c7886bb-c538-4e5c-84b5-199290382247">Scott Stewar</a>t, though. He rocks. It was a real honor to meet him in person at the banquet. Dawn laughed at my giddy schoolgirl approach at meeting a drum corps legend.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dawn, we've been spending a lot of time together even though she moved to Michigan. It's only 2hrs away, so it's not a huge deal. It's not much different than driving up to the Northern suburbs. I drove her home from the banquet last weekend. Due to bad weather I stayed there Monday and just worked remotely. Had a lot of fun with her and her roommate, Ron. We hung out while Dawn slept sunday night, was a good time.</p>
<p>Today I have a list of things to do. Laundry, clean apartment, and work on music. I already placed a big order through drugstore.com in order to blow some of my flex spending cash I have left. Lots of cough drops, claritin, and other random stuff i'm sure i'll need throughout the year. So i'm stocked up for a while.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Worst.  Holiday.  Season.  Ever.</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/12/worst-holiday-season-ever</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first holiday season I've ever spent completely alone.</p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of Christmas time to begin with. I hate shopping. I hate trying to figure out what people want. I'm bad it, and I buy people complete crap. At least with Dragon Woman she'd help me shop for people, and people would end getting stuff they actually liked. I'd be forced to have even a little bit of holiday spirit, but this year I don't have any of that. No tree, no lights. No gifts waiting to be given. They're all just stuck in the trunk of my car. There's not one piece of holiday spirit anywhere in my apartment, and I really don't care to change that.</p>
<p>It's a time of year I don't enjoy, and I'm spending it alone.. and it sucks. All of the things I have to do, I'm doing it alone... and it sucks. Nobody to ask questions. Nobody to go with me to keep me company. When I go up to visit my family this weekend i'll be there alone. Nobody to comfort me and nobody to be next to in order for things to feel like they'll be ok. When they're off talking about whatever it is they're interested in, i'll be alone and wanting to leave.</p>
<p>Now don't think i'm being all down and depressed, I'm not. I am, however, just plain sad. Nothing all that great has been happening lately. I've been living paycheck to paycheck thanks to my required payments to the ex, so adding the gift shopping sure doesn't help things at all.</p>
<p>Sorry to be such a downer. But seriously, if Jesus is the reason for the season, and I don't believe in Jesus.. wtf am I doing?</p>
<p>Gonna go start on my annual year in review post now. I've done it every year for the past 4yrs or so, so I can't flake on it now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I threw up at Cloverfield</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/01/i-threw-up-at-cloverfield</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick update to tell everyone that I threw up at Cloverfield last night.</p>
<p>It was the second time of me seeing it. I had a full meal (with desert) at Steak and Shake just moments before going to the theater. I hadn't felt all that great all day, a little dizzy and such.</p>
<p>I figure about 40min into the movie and it was time to go. Threw up in a garbage can right in the hallway.</p>
<p>I'm oddly proud of this feat.</p>
<p>Cloverfield rocks!!!!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So my buddy Joe at work sent me a link to The Lincoln Park Chad Society web page today. This is the best thing ever.

Instead, I can just show them this... what I <strong>don't</strong> want to have in a girl!</p>

      <title>PandoraFM defaced yesterday</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/02/pandorafm-defaced-yesterday</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday morning PandoraFM was defaced.</p>
<p>A hacker, not unknown to me from the past, put up some pretty graphic text on the front page of PandoraFM about me. Things i'd never say were posted up, along with mention of contacting "my girlfriend" and family as well. Except I don't have a girlfriend. And the photo he had up was extremely old, certainly not one i'd ever use.</p>
<p>I got ahold of the guy on IRC and talked to him for a bit. He said it was nothing personal. I don't really understand that completely. I mean, I've done some things to people online in the distant past that were pretty mean and I'm sorry I did. It was rarely personal, and all for the thrill. It's the anarchy of the "old Internet". Those who don't understand probably never will. Seeing the web site defacement almost made me chuckle (almost). A taste of nostalgia. I suppose in the end it was no harm done, right?</p>
<p>I'm sure I sound crazy with my "no harm done" talk, since he made personal attacks against me. And i'd probably be a lot more upset about it if he wasn't willing to virtually sit down with me and explain that he had nothing against me. He told me he'd leave me alone from now on, and I'll take him on his word.</p>
<p>Like someone mentioned, it's almost slightly flattering.</p>
<p>Lastly, someone asked if any passwords were compromised on PandoraFM. The answer is absolutely not. Passwords are not stored within the system and only passed along for temporary use when you log in. I mean, you can never say that the guy wasn't sniffing traffic or something... who knows. But there's no storing of passwords in PandoraFM and no way for him to get any kind of dump of credentials ever used.</p>
<p>I apologize for the down time yesterday and I hope things will stay quiet.</p>

      <title>Bad music (video)</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/02/untitled-1-5</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seriously. Do people really listen to music like this? This is awful. What does "Talking out of the side of your neck" even mean?</p>
<p>Plus they use a really bad stereotype of marching band members dancing and spinning and using a mace. I hate that crap.</p>

      <title>Damnit.  I'm one of *them*</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/03/damnit-im-one-of-them</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I joined a gym today. Damnit. Now i'm one of those assholes. I told myself I wouldn't do that. Be throwing "Yeah, I totally have to go and work out tonight" into conversations to make yourself feel like... something. I don't know. But it's lame. And I don't want to be one of them. But I wanted to do it for myself, so I am. So I put $150 on a 2yr membership with Bally's Fitness because it's the closest to my apartment, and maybe i'll go often enough to make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>People who let a gym, or their bodies, or their health define them are stupid, stupid people that I can't stand. And I refuse to become one of them. I'm doing it only because I feel I should because i've gained some weight in the past year and I should take it off. Nothing more than that. I don't want to "bulk up", "tone" or in any way "feel the burn".</p>
<p>Just so you know.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Gabe's Smart Shuffle.  One playlist to rule them all.</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/04/gabes-smart-shuffle-one-playlist-to-rule-them-all</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&lt;p&gt;The discussion of smart playlists in iTunes came up in #TheCabin today. And I thought I'd post up the details of how my iPod lifeline, &quot;Smart Shuffle&quot; works. I call the playlist that because it's a true shuffle, but within the world I want to give it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, this is really just for your iPod, not for your full library on your computer. So let's pretend you have a completely empty iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a static playlist (my term for a playlist you drag and drop songs into to make a list of songs, not a smart playlist) called &quot;Add To iPod&quot;. Start adding things to it that you'll want on your iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061021.jpg&quot; width=&quot;418&quot; height=&quot;154&quot; alt=&quot;200804061021.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next create a smart playlist called &quot;Most Played&quot;. Make it look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061025.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; alt=&quot;200804061025.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next create a smart playlist called &quot;Random&quot;. Make it look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061026.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; alt=&quot;200804061026.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll give you random songs you haven't listened to recently, isn't something you've already selected to put on your iPod manually (Add to iPod list) and haven't skipped (maybe you don't like it?), but also isn't an old favorite you listened to a lot (In your most played). So you'll get some songs maybe you've never heard before, and you might really like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite side, create one called &quot;Recently Played&quot; to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061029.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; alt=&quot;200804061029.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next create a smart playlist called &quot;New Music&quot;. Make it look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061027.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; alt=&quot;200804061027.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So any of your new albums will always be around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create another playlist called &quot;iPod Sync&quot; that'll be your &quot;master&quot; sync list to your iPod. Have it encompass other lists you've created. It can look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061033.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;301&quot; alt=&quot;200804061033.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that list (and other playlists you've created) are selected in the playlist sync tab in iTunes when your iPod is plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then off to make the final &quot;Smart Shuffle&quot; playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061036.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;346&quot; alt=&quot;200804061036.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you'll end up with tracks that aren't a Podcast, that aren't really long, but not really short. Actually have Artist and Track names to display, fit within all the other playlists you've created (that live within the iPod Sync list), isn't something that you've skipped recently (obviously you didn't want to listen to it). And you can add other things as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I had a dream last night I was on CabinDuDe, the bot of #thecabin's party line.  And then people I've been working with from Omaha at work also joined.  We were using it for a chat for work.  And then madcow joined and started listening in.  It was a pretty crazy dream.
I generally don't remember my dreams, but for some reason the past couple nights I have.  Odd.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Saturday Night @ Mannequin Nightclub</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/04/saturday-night-mannequin-nightclub</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you look back at something and realize you're lucky to be alive or not in jail, I suppose it's a worthy story to share.</p>
<div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">
  So Ron and I made plans to hit up <a href="http://mannequinchicago.com/">Mannequin Nightclub</a> (mentioned as "the hottest new club in Chicago" by some dude there). We reserved a table for VIP bottle service.<br />
  We got to the club around 11:00pm and were really having a good time. I've never done VIP before in a big club, so it was nice to have our table and just hang out talking to people. At 11:18 we were at our table, and around 11:30pm we probably got our bottle and mixers.</p>
</div>
<div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">
  12:08 we found our bottle of Grey Goose vodka was half empty when we came back to our table. Someone made themselves a really strong drink with our stuff. Ron complained that security let that happened. So in return they started bringing us rounds of shots to try and appease us. And these shots just kept on coming, and we were having a great time. (See photos)
</div>
<div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">
<p>  <img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/IMG_0789.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="IMG_0789.JPG" /> <img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/IMG_0790.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="IMG_0790.JPG" /> <img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/IMG_0788.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="IMG_0788.JPG" />
</div>
<div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">
  According to txt messages 2:50am showed me away from Ron and heading back to our table upstairs. When getting there I found we got a replacement full bottle of vodka, but I wasn't feeling well. Somewhere between 2:50 and 2:57 I threw up and was kicked out of the club. Probably by 3:00am I was passed out in a doorway on the side of the building. I'm sure I was resting well until an extremely large, bright light woke me up at 4:11am. It was the police telling me "this isn't a very good place to be sleeping." I fumbled for my phone and said "A friend is coming right now." Or I think I tried to say that, anyway. Who knows what came out. 4:31am the cops came back to ask "Is your friend still coming?". Of course nobody was coming, Ron since lost his phone in the club, and I was a mess.
</div>
<div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">
  By the time I found Ron hanging out randomly outside the club after the second time the cops came Grace had already convinced me to get a cab to her place. Best choice ever. At 5:03 we were at Grace's. I was alive, not in jail, and the night was over.
</div>
<div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">
  The next day I stopped at my office to get a spare set of apartment and car keys. My car was still valet parked somewhere, and no matter who I called I couldn't get any answer on how to get my car back. So we looked around for 45min around the club and finally found my car hidden away in a parking garage. Drove it out and back home. Success!</p>

      <title>Goodbye BME</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/05/goodbye-bme</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm sad to say that things have changed with one of my favorite, and most inspirational blogs. The sole guy who has run Modblog (and all other associated BME properties) has had to transfer his ownership to someone else and leave the place.</p>
<p>BME, the de-facto location online for all things body modification related is a pretty important place for a lot of people. It's really the most educational blog that I read in the sense of people in the real world doing real things, and how it comes out... better or worse. It's not just photos of people putting holes in their heads. More importantly it's photos of people putting holes in their heads and the resulting story of how it went very, very wrong. And then everyone learns something from the experience. Sometimes it's silly stuff, like, i dunno, don't use rusty nails for piercing jewelry. But other times it's a true story of human body experimentation and how it comes out. <a href="http://modblog.bmezine.com/2007/07/02/three-blind-mice/">Eyeball tattoo</a>s anyone?</p>
<p>For better, or worse, I know I wouldn't have goofy stuff embedded into my body if it weren't for this site. The galleries let you see what creative things people have done, and it's inspiring. After you're inspired, and you execute on your vision, then you upload your photo and start the cycle for someone else.</p>
<p>So I wish the best for BME, and Shannon who's given me doses of crazy body modification many times per day since I've followed Modblog.</p>
<p>I'll repost below for people who may not want to visit BME sites from work (don't blame you).</p>
<blockquote cite="http://modblog.bmezine.com/2008/05/14/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/">
<p>After a personally difficult legal dispute over BME, I’ve had to face the potentially insurmountable reality of being massively in debt, and I have chosen to transfer the business to Rachel (the details of this deal are sealed, so please don’t ask). Within the month my role at BME will come to an end, and new staff (made up largely of people who’ve been working on BME for some time as well) will be taking over. I will no longer be writing online about body modification, although I will be maintaining my regular blog and other projects of course, as well as working on several body modification book projects which I am eager to complete.</p>
<p>It’s definitely a very strange and mixed set of feelings, having run this site from the very beginning, over nearly a decade and a half. On one hand I’m very much looking forward to having the opportunity and time to paint and tackle new adventures, and on the other hand I will very much miss both the people and the subject in general that I came to know through BME. That said, when I grew up and fell in love with body modification — and later built BME — this was a very different and much more “outsider” culture, so maybe now, as not just tattooing but body modification as a whole enjoys unprecedented levels of popularity and acceptability, it is a good time to pass the torch on to a new generation. It’s my hope that they maintain the site in the spirit that it was begun, while taking on the challenges of a new environment.</p>
<p>I have very much enjoyed being a part of BME and I leave it with good memories. Thank you to everyone who’s been a friend of the site, and everyone who’s helped bring it to this point. I hope you’ve enjoyed my contributions — I know I’ve enjoyed yours — and I hope that you continue to enjoy what BME brings in the future.</p>
<p>See you in hell! :P</p>

      <title>I'm not doing well</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/05/im-not-doing-well</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As some of you probably know, I'm a complete nutcase. Not in the "oh look at me, I'm so different and cute." No, in the way that I'm seriously fucked in the head and there's a possibility I may hurt you, hurt someone you know, or hurt myself on any given day.</p>
<p>Luckily nobody has been injured thus far, but a few broken items in my apartment were harmed in the past week or so.</p>
<p>Why do I say this? Things are pretty bad. I've been on some meds for the past year to control this crap. About two weeks ago I ran out and I've been unable to get ahold of my doctor to schedule an appointment or get refills. I didn't realize how much those medications ran my life until now, when I'm off them.</p>
<p>People are work are more or less scared of me. I've told no less than three people that I've quit my job. People are feeling like they have to go out of their way to try and make me feel valued and appreciated or they'll wake up one morning and I won't be showing up at work anymore. That or they feel like I'm going to show up with a knife. I wish I could say that neither are a possibility.</p>
<p>It's probably the worst time, ever, to be going through this, too. Work is extremely stressful right now, and I just can't deal with it in my current unmedicated state. Huge things are at stake with a project that I've been working on for almost a year. And now I'm looking at only mere hours until things go live I'm getting all fucked in the head and refusing to work on it anymore.</p>
<p>This on top of the fact I'm going through major withdrawal symptoms from being off of some serious brain fuck medications cold turkey. Headaches, dizziness, nausea, and the fine occurrence known as "brain zaps", where it feels like you've been electrocuted for a brief second.</p>
<p>I wish I could just put out a press release saying "please just ignore me for the near future, I'm going to say and do things i'll later regret. Don't be here when it happens."</p>
<p>I'm so sorry everyone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I'm someone's bitch</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/05/im-someones-bitch</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I went to lunch with an ex-coworker and current coworker Friday. It was an eye opening experience. To make it short, they made me realize all of the actual responsibilities that used any type of knowledge I have are being taken from me one day at a time. Instead being replaced by fucking bullshit monkey tasks.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to feel like when I wake up every morning is that I'm someone's bitch, doing things I don't believe in, and have no say in.</p>
<p>So I decided unless things change, unless I get away from this fucking cocksucking micromanaging asshole of a "manager", I'll be leaving the company once this project is complete (and I use up my vacation time).</p>
<p>It sucks. I really like the company. I really used to like my job. But I woke up one day and someone replace my position with another one (they're even going to change my title) and I'm not cool with it. So fuck 'em. Replace me with fucking monkey.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Happy Friday, Internet!</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/06/happy-friday-internet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone. Happy Friday, hope your week wasn't too awful.</p>
<p>I need to start making more new posts on my blog. Sometimes it's the only way people know what's going on, but I'm generally pretty bad at filtering out what's important and interesting and relaying that on to people. In my mind it's all boring and nobody cares but myself. But ever notice that's generally true? When someone asks "how was your day?" they're just being nice. If you actually started going into detail about how your day was they'd probably lose interest within seconds. It's the same thing when someone asks "so what do you do?" I'm always tempted to say "I work at McDonalds" since it's just easier, and the end result really wouldn't change much.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>So guess what? I put in for a week of vacation. A full week. I don't know the last time I've ever, ever done that. So starting July 7th I'm off work. That's 10 days with the holiday and weekends. I'm excited to sit down with my music and really get some things done that I've been putting off. That and spending time with friends and all that kind of fun stuff. I'm really excited. I have no scheduled plans through though the whole thing, but I'm sure i'll fill it with good fun.</p>
<p>Tonight I'm going to Ginny's and meeting her friend Missy. GInny is making dinner and it'll be a good start to a weekend.</p>
<p>What else? Oh, I'll be going to see Too much light makes the baby go blind... after oh, many many years of wanting to see it. I never had anyone that would want to go see shows with me in the past, and I wouldn't go to something like that myself.</p>
<p>Work? Eh i dunno. Every day it's changing more and more. It's really a downer. I don't hate my job, and I like to think I'm good at my job.. or what my job used to be. But now it's turned into something else. Something I'm not so good at or care much about. It's now much more client focused, and that's just not my thing. I'm a systems guy. I do the plumbing and the electrical. I'm not so good at trying to lease the house and worry about if the new tenants are happy with their water pressure. Hows that for an analogy? Pretty good, huh? Coworker of mine keeps telling me to join the engineering team. It's slightly tempting, to be honest. But I think of development much like an art. When I work on projects that enable me to build something, it's me taking nothing and creatively building something. If It were my job, and I was told how to do it, when to do it, and why to do it... I think any excitement I'd have for building something would be gone. But it's something to think about. I don't know if that's a lateral step, a step up, or a step down. I really don't know.</p>
<p>Hope everyone has a good weekend!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Let's have a talk.  Have a seat.</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/06/lets-have-a-talk-have-a-seat</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have a seat. We're going to have a little talk.
I often don't talk about my personal life when it comes to other people. Once in a while i'll put a blurb about work, or myself, but generally it's about broad topics that I hope are interesting to read. But I think this topic needs a little explanation.</p>
<p>I'll start with the simple stuff. Good news, I met a girl! Her name is Ginny. She's great girl that I've known a few weeks now and I'm really excited about her. Now don't get me wrong, I've done my fair share of dating since I've been single. I've met cool people, had a lot of fun, but nothing serious.</p>
<p>So how about I tell you some things about her. She's 24, she lives in Chicago. She has good music taste, she has some awesome tattoos, enjoys pizza and burgers, is a sci-fi nerd, a cute puppy, and a great husband. Yes, you read that right. My girlfriend is married. I'll let you all catch your breath.</p>
<p>Since many people reading this may be in shock, let me explain. Her and her husband are in a polyamorous relationship. They realize they are able to love more than just one person in their lives. This allows her and I to date as any new couple dating would.</p>
<p>So you're wondering what the place of her husband is in all of this. Think of it this way. People have other people in their lives no matter who they are. Weather it's friends, or family, or roommates.. it doesn't matter. Every person in someone's life gives and takes a little bit. If Ginny wasn't married maybe she'd have a roommate. A roommate who she was close to, went out to dinner with, hung out with, and generally spent time with. They could be really close and even share love for each other, male or female. This is how I see her and her husband. They're two people who love each other, share a life and a home together, yet know that even though time may not be unlimited, feelings are. They have room for other people in their lives if someone happens to fit.</p>
<p>What do I think about all of this? Only good things. Patrick, Ginny's husband, is a great guy. We have a lot in common and we get along really well. He's even a musician and I hope him and I can get together and jam sometime soon. I think him and I can be really good friends and I look forward to it. This is no different than if Ginny lived with a roommate who I had common interests with and the three of us all hung out. It's just a really neat arrangement all around. They love each other, yet her and I have the excitement of a new relationship that any monogamous couple could never have, and I get a pre-screened friend on top of it all.</p>
<p>The drawbacks? Like I alluded to earlier, time. Time isn't unlimited. So scheduling is key. When is Ginny where? She's busy as it is, but she's more than willing to make time for me. In fact she's excited at the thought of seeing me and shares that feeling with Pat. In return Pat is happy for her because she's happy and excited and gets that special tingly feeling in her stomach that a long standing relationship doesn't really have.</p>
<p>Is everything all perfect? Absolutely not. Before meeting Ginny I would have told you that the idea is crazy, so I completely understand any questions you may have in your mind. Now in just a short time I've seen how a complex situation with multiple people can become a natural yet exciting way to integrate with a person (people). It's really not as crazy as you might think.</p>
<p>When talking to friends I've been told I'm "helping her commit adultery", or "if she's married she's not your girlfriend", or "she's just using you until she's bored". So anything negative I've probably heard already. Open your mind and realize there's more ways to live your life than what you see every day. None are better or worse. But different can be good.</p>

      <title>Place sharp tube.  Insert through flesh.</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/06/place-sharp-tube-insert-through-flesh</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Went and got my right ear "fixed" yesterday. I let it heal since the 2g hole through my lobe never was doing well. So i let it heal completely over a couple months, and yesterday my buddy <a href="http://native-rituals.com/johnny.html">Johnny</a> over at <a href="http://native-rituals.com/">Native Rituals</a> said I'm good to have a go at it again.</p>
<p>I snapped a picture of the 4g needle. Calling it a needle, though, is really incorrect. It's a large tube with a sharp edge. It does not pierce. It tunnels. The flesh gets torn as it plows through it. And you hear it. Oh, you hear it.</p>
<p>Since phones take awful pictures, I apologize. But I thought I'd take a picture anyway. This is the 4g needle. Then a 2g taper was placed to stretch it. Hah!</p>

      <title>Hello Inkernet</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/07/hello-inkernet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Been a while since I posted anything, so I thought I'd say hi.
Couple weeks ago I had my week off of work, and it was great. I don't think I've ever had a week off like that before, and I really think it's something that needs to happen every year.</p>
<p>This year my focus was to work on my music. Sometimes with everything you have to do in life you never get time to do the things you want to do. So this was my time to do what I wanted to do, and it paid off. I really got a lot done and I'm excited to be sooo much closer to finishing things.</p>
<p>I'm sure any readers of the post about <a href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/?p=507">me meeting the girl</a> may be wondering how things are going. Honestly... never better. And that's not just some spin on the topic, it really is going well. We see each other a lot, and we have a blast. When it's not just the two of us, it's the three of us. Pat, her and I spend a lot of time together and it's great. I can't say enough good things about her, so I won't try to.</p>
<p>Work? Not so good. Maybe worse by the day. I really think the time for me, and others I've talked to, is limited. People will start walking soon. I'm embarrassed to work there and I've started to send out feelers out in the world to see what my options may be, and I'll see how that goes before I make any kind of decisions. I have got a couple pings back, so it's nice to have in my back pocket for later. There's really no reason to <a href="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/?p=494">bitch in detail about work</a> anymore here on my blog, or elsewhere. That time is over.</p>
<p>Next Saturday I'm going to visit my parents in Wisconsin. It'll be a quick trip, but that's ok. I have enough going on here at home where I don't need to be spending multiple days away.</p>
<p>So that's a quick update on my world. Hope all is well with all of you!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Hellooooo Omaha</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/08/hellooooo-omaha</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So like I said in a previous post, the time to complain about my job and the direction of my role is over. it's time to start doing something to better my situation.</p>
<p>So that time started last night when I applied for an open position in the Load balancer/unix scripting/sendmail/qmail team in Omaha, NE. Unix! I miss you!</p>
<p>Does it sound like a great match to what I'm good at? Absolutely? Do I want to move to Omaha? Not really. But it certainly won't hurt to discuss the opening.</p>
<p>But you never know. It sounds right up my alley, all things i'm good at kind of rolled up into one position. We'll see what happens...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I owe you all an update</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/08/i-owe-you-all-an-update-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, Internet.  I have a few topics to discuss, in no particular order.
Ginny and I broke up.  I'm taking it pretty hard.</p>
<p>We were only together for comparitively a short time, but honestly it was an amazing time.  She took me by the hand and walked me through so many new things.  It went from me not understanding how someone could be a part of someone's life if they were married to integrating seamlessly into not just the life of one person, but the family of two.  I loved her dogs like they were my own, and I became close with her husband, Pat, who I found I had a lot in common with.</p>
<p>I'm not going to talk about how shitty I feel, or any of the details.  It's something i'll have to work through alone and hope that time will heal the wounds.  Just know this is very odd for me.  I'm usually one to bounce back from something like this, but it's different.  She's different.</p>
<p>Twelve people applied for the position I mentioned before.  Two got initial HR interviews.  I was one of the two.  Then I got a phone interview with the hiring manager.  And he likes me.  But honestly, I don't see why he wouldn't.  I feel like i'm interviewing to get my old job back, so i'd fit right in.  And i'm damn good at what I do, when it is "what I do".  My job now is not "what I do", so i'm not so good at it.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?  I think my time is limited in my current role.  All of management knows of my intentions, and I hope they're supportive.  It's pretty obvious that what my role has turned into has become something i'm not compatible with, so I have to move on.  I'll even be at the same company, so it should be easy for everyone.</p>
<p>All in all, there's a lot going on right now.  So I'm sure I can use anyone's support if you're willing to offer it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>You are being judged</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/08/you-are-being-judged</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does anyone else get these things from Facebook "Compare People"? It's always interesting how you're ranked compared to others. Here's my current standings:</p>
<p>#1 craziest (gained 1 place)<br />
#2 person with the best taste in music (gained 1 place)<br />
#3 nicest (gained 1 place)<br />
#5 best room-mate (gained 1 place)<br />
#6 most entertaining (gained 1 place)</p>
<p>Best room-mate? Really? I'd be the worst. I've only lived with one person before, and it ended awful. We accidently got married one time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Chronicling my time in Chicagoland #1</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/09/chronicling-my-time-in-chicagoland-1</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I called my buddy Sean at <a href="http://www.oldtowntatu.com/">Old Town Tatu</a> to schedule my Illinois state tattoo. Tuesday night at 8pm. Not sure where it's going yet, or in what style... but he's an awesome artist, and i'll work with him on it. I just want to take Illinois with me when I go.
I sent out a blast email (and myspace post) today to everyone letting them know of my time table. I hope to squeeze every bit of excitement out of this place before I go. And i'll try my hardest to blog it all.</p>
<p>Tonight I'm meeting up with Katie and Tracy at the Green Eye. Tracy used to live in Omaha, so i'm using her as a really helpful resource. Katie said Frank is going to go too, I'm excited!!</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I think i'm going to (shamelessly) meet up with Garnet to watch Desperate Housewives.</p>
<p>Oh speaking of Garnet.. her and I went to a sushi place last night. I actually had sushi, first time ever. It didn't really do it for me, but it was probably because I was petrified. But I did have a lot of fun, and we were both proud of me for trying it. I'd go again.</p>
<p>And since i'm throwing stuff in that i've been doing... last Sunday I went to the Hideout Block Party with Rachel and had a great time watching some great bands. Even saw 100 random people dressed as zombies do the dance from Thriller. You don't get that in Nebraska.</p>
<p>My first trip to Omaha is scheduled Oct 9th - 14th. They're getting me a corporate credit card, so that'll be really nice that I don't have to front any cash through this process.</p>

      <title>Gabe's Gym Story</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/09/gabes-gym-story</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I took my gym going to another level.</p>
<p>I haven't been going often... at all. So I figured I needed help if I were to expedite the degutting process. So last week I signed up for a personal trainer at the local Bally's.</p>
<p>I got Jen, a cute, short, bubbly girl. Oh yeah. She's also the manager and just finished her first Iron Man Triathlon this past weekend.</p>
<p>She kicked my ass last night. About 45min into my hour session I had to stop because the room was spinning. She said my blood sugar got too low and got me some Gatorade. I did feel better after that. Then we sat down and she said something about the food I eat... "How much did you pay for personal training? And how much did you pay for the mostacholi? Throw away the leftover mostacholi."</p>
<p>My choices are a) lifestyle change or b) blow it off. Both are valid.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Hello Omaha part 2</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/09/hello-omaha-part-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it's official. October will be the last month I live in the fine state of Illinois.
Who would have ever thought, right? But yesterday I accepted the position in Omaha, NE with West.</p>
<p>My first day in my new role will be October 6th, so I gave West Notifications my 2 weeks yesterday. After that they're going to fly me out a couple times so I can find somewhere to live, meet my team, and get my move situated. It looks like they're really going to take care of me, even paying to break my lease in my apartment.</p>
<p>So I guess there's not much to say right now other than it's going to happen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

So, let me know when you're moving.......I will of course help out (once again).....:)  It's my job as your publicist to at least put in an appearance.
So you got your very own blog on Hyphenate and it is well deserved.</p>

      <title>Just a little frustrated</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/09/just-a-little-frustrated</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just in the past two days two people announced they are leaving the company. Why does that bother me? Because I'm not one of them.</p>
<p>I'm just so frustrated. I try so hard here. I really do. I'm good at what I do and I think i'm seen as an important asset. But management is just turning this place into a fucking zoo.</p>
<p>I never told you about the SOCOM initiative. Where you're in a rotation of people who sit in front of three monitors and do nothing but watch how high the numbers go. If it gets too high, you lets someone know. Or the new and improved version of it, where you also have to do it over the weekend. In front of a computer... on the weekend... watching numbers. I can't make this shit up. I'm totally serious.</p>
<p>My team, the infrastructure, platform engineering team, has been turned into a client support team. And I just can't take it anymore. I don't care about clients. I don't. Not a bit. If they all left.. I wouldn't care. I care about the environment, and how to make it better. Not how happy some suit in California is. That's someone else's job.</p>
<p>I'm just really upset with this place. I'm trying my best to make my opinions known, but management here doesn't get it. They just don't.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven days from today I'll be on my way to Omaha. A moving company is coming first thing Saturday morning to put everything on a truck and off I go. Sounds so simple.</p>
<p>In honor of me leaving, I put together a quick collection of some photos of random times/events/entertaining things that took place here. I have another week to make some more great memories, but here's a little selection so far.</p>

      <title>Anyone shop online for clothes?  Aparently it's more difficult than I thought.</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/10/anyone-shop-online-for-clothes-aparently-its-more-difficult-than-i-thought</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seems like right now is the first time in a while i've just been sitting around relaxing. Threw some laundry in, picked up a little. Probably get back to packing this weekend at some point.</p>
<p>A week from right now I'll already be in Omaha. Slightly surreal.</p>
<p>I'm trying to go through online and bookmark new clothes, since I'm having to go through an overhaul of my wardrobe. I can no longer wear concert tshirts and cartoon characters to work. No huge deal, everywhere else i've worked has been business casual too. It's just been a few years since I've been in that environment, and my stuff isn't anything I'm willing to wear anymore. Last weekend I bought a few new shirts, couple pairs of pants, and a new pair of shoes. And there's only more to go.</p>
<p>However, looking for new clothes online is something of a joke. I've never really used the internet for "real clothes" before, just tshirts and things I know what i'm looking for. If you go to Amazon under men's shirts you get get like "Viewing 1 - 24 of 29,000". How is that at all manageable? I don't know what I'm looking for, I just know I need new shirts. But there's got to be a better way. Seems Yahoo shopping at least can sort by colour, so that's a start.</p>
<p>Yesterday was my last day at West Notifications Group. I was told there was going to be some kind of going away thing at some point before I move. But for now I'm going back to my same seat Monday morning. Just working on a different team. I called my new manager Friday and asked what the plan wast for Monday. He didn't really have one yet, but that's understandable. It's not like he can just sit down with me and get me in the game. I'll probably just start logging into systems and getting used to things until I finally get to HQ on Thursday.</p>
<p>Last night I went out with Frank, Tracy, Katie and Frank's friend Rachel who's from Omaha. I came home early, though. It's been a long week and I was beat. But I have another Omaha contact now in case I have questions. You can't beat that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Apartment hunting == not fun</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/10/apartment-hunting-not-fun</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Went out with Jillian today to look at apartments. She was really helpful. She's looking in the Dundee area just like I am. I'm not sure how i'd get anything done around here without all the helpful people i'm meeting! The last lady I talked to sounded about 10 years past death. She sounded like she didn't believe what company I worked for because she's lived here all her life, and she's never heard of it. She asked what they do. The real answer is "anything for enough money", but how do you explain a technology company to a 250 year old?</p>
<p>We left a lot of messages for places, and a couple appointments for tomorrow. A lot of the big rental companies aren't open on the weekend... and that really sucks for me. I guess if worst came to worst I'll have to take time out of the work day monday and/or tuesday to take care of it. This is my primary focus right now... I only have so much time.</p>
<p>In just a bit i'll be taking off to meet up with Boutcher, a cool guy at my company who's been a huge help to me, and then head over a party thrown by another company guy. Awesome. I'm a part of the in crowd!</p>
<p>I'll have to take pictures. But for now, I want coffee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Chronicling my time in Chicago #2</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/10/chronicling-my-time-in-chicago-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So last weekend when I last blogged I met up with Katie, Tracy, Michelle and Frank. We had a blast! This Friday night we hope to go out and be all stupid again. In fact, a friend of Frank's (ex-girlfriend's sister actually) is from Omaha, and is in town. So she's going to go out with us. I have so many awesome resources for this move, I can't complain one bit. Tracy has been a huge help as well, helping me map out the different areas I should be looking for apartments next week.
Oh yeah, got all my travel information for next week. Flights, rental car, hotel. How very official. I'm excited for my trip, but nervous. I don't know what to expect.</p>
<p>Last night (I use night lightly, it was also morning) I visited Sean at Old Town Tatu to execute my Illinois tattoo. I sent him some design ideas earlier in the week, and he was excited about the idea. And holy shit, did it come out awesome. I love his work, and I couldn't be happier. However, i'm pretty tired. I didn't get out of there until after 3am.</p>
<p>Check it out, yo.</p>

      <title>Chronicling my time in Chicago #3</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/10/chronicling-my-time-in-chicago-3</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I've been back now since Tuesday night. I can say it's slightly odd being back. I had a nice going away lunch with my old team Wednesday, and went out last night after work with some of the Chicago people for dinner and drinks.</p>
<p>I'm seeing more and more people moving on with their lives without me in it. Makes sense, and completely expected, but often hard to watch. People I would be spending more time with and be close to, but given the limited time it's easier just to let things move on by. I'm trying not to completely take this position on things, however. Saw Karen Thursday, seeing Garnet Sunday, seeing Missy Monday. On top of that I have quite the list of people that I also need to get in touch with, possibly for the last time, before I go.</p>
<p>13 days.</p>
<p>But, I got an apartment! The one I wanted, and it's pretty great. 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, walk-in closet, and it's larger than my current one. I'm quite happy with that. If only for the fact I was quite worried I was going to go back to Omaha without a place to live.</p>
<p>I took Tuesday off. Figured a dedicated day to do whatever I need to do would be good. I may have to take another before I leave, we'll see.</p>
<p>What do I have for plans tonight? Nothing! Ack! I better change that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Good morning, Omaha</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/10/good-morning-omaha</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Was an exciting weekend to say the least.  Friday night I went out with Jess, who's introducing me to some great people.  Saturday and Sunday I met up with Jillian who's looking for apartments and is kind enough to let me tag along.  And Saturday night I went to a coworker's party that followed the Alcohol + Fire = Burning Things rule.  <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1948788">Here's the video!</a>I have an application for one apartment, but that's it so far.  Everywhere is managed by companies that aren't open on weekends, so I'll probably get a slew of calls today and tomorrow.  I'm just not so sure I'll have time to see them all.  I put in a lot of calls, so I expect a lot of returns soon.  At the very least i'll turn in this one application for a duplex place and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Tonight i'm going to a show Jillian invited me to.  My first Omaha concert!  Cool!  I think i'm getting sick, though, so I better take care of myself.  If I have to i'll take some time off when I get home to pack and rest and get everything in order.  I think i'm a wee stressed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My last day at the Chicago office</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/10/my-last-day-at-the-chicago-office</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today i'm saying my goodbye's at the Chicago office.  There's a get together after work today at a local pub and it seems like a decent amount of people are going to be showing up.
Just got back a few ago from my last ROM coffee run.  My secret crush, Lilly, wasn't there, though.</p>
<p>My desk is clean, things are packed up for me to bring home... another chapter closed in the big book of relocation.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have to finish packing.  That's primary goal #1.  I'm pretty much done anyway, but I'm being slightly paranoid about it.  If time allows I'm trying to piece together a Casey Tatum costume for Halloween tomorrow night.  If I can't, no biggie.  But I am going to go to Flat Top for dinner tomorrow and then hit a few of the Halloween hot spots.  I can't be out tooo late, though.  The movers will be there at 8am, and I need to be in tip-top, not hungover, shape.</p>
<p>But I guess everything is done.  Nothing more really to say.  I'll take some photos the next couple days with me and friends and then things begin anew in Nebraska.</p>
<p>Crazy.  Crazy awesome?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I should update more often.  Here's one.</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/11/580</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, friends.</p>
<p>No huge updates going on.  I've been trying to get everything in order here, to the best of my ability.  Unpacking boxes, putting things places.  Got my surround sound kicking in my livingroom with my AppleTV attached.  Have my two wireless networks running (802.11g and 802.11n as to not to share frequencies), and little by little going through clothes that are in boxes and putting them away.</p>
<p>I was wondering why it is I had so much clothes still packed away.  And then I realize, with 5 days a week at work... I don't wear many tshirts anymore like I used to.  In the Chicago office it was completely casual dress.  But here it's "business casual", so I bought all new clothes to work here. And in turn, my Super Mario shirts wait patiently to be worn again.</p>
<p>As for my social life here in the big O!, things are well on that front.  I've been spending a lot of time with a great girl, Kat.  She's been an amazing friend to me here and we have a lot of fun.  She is 100% geek, it's really cool to have someone around that gets all the references in that subculture.</p>
<p>My parents are trying to figure out when and how I plan on getting to the UP for Christmas.  Every option is a bad one.  There's drive 12 hours, or fly to Madison, WI to meet up with them, and then drive 7 hours, or attempt to fly from Omaha to Negaunee with a handful of transfers; with no promise you'll actually land in the UP.  Keeping in mind that every one of the "fly" options requires at least one transfer of stuff to another medium, and there will be Christmas gifts involved... that sucks.  So I guess i'll just drive.  It's the best of the bad options.  To be honest i'd be perfectly fine hanging out in Omaha for Christmas.  I really like this city and leaving it for the holiday feels like i'm not giving it a fair chance.  I fit in better here anyway, for the most part.</p>
<p>So tonight i'm hanging out with Kat, and at 23:00 I have some stuff to do for work.  And it's almost the weekend.  Huzzah!  Not that I have plans thus far, but I'm sure I'll keep busy.</p>
<p>Stay r33t.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I like Omaha</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/11/i-like-omaha</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just ventured to downtown Omaha. It's the area I haven't been to yet. I went off the beaten path and found the area I heard so much about called "Old Market". For a few blocks here, I don't feel like i'm in Omaha anymore.</p>
<p>I found a coffee shop with wifi here, and that's where i'm blogging from. Before this I went to a couple record stores. RECORD stores. With posters, and old vinyl, and all the kind of niche stuff you'd only see in chicago small independent shops. They have Omaha small independent shops, and I love it.</p>
<p>I really came to find food, but i'm so busy looking at all the awesome places I'll just have to get something to eat on the way back home.</p>
<p>Given all the shitty stuff that's going on with this move, I'm happy tonight.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I'm here. There's a lot to blog about, really. But it's midnight, and I don't think i'd be able to do everything justice at this point. So at this point let me just offer up a couple videos I made. More to come!</p>

      <link>/blog/2008/12/followup-on-ingestion-tactics</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is Thursday.  The 4th full day without any meat.  I'm sure it's by far the longest stretch of doing so in my whole life.  *maybe* i've gone a whole day without eating meat once.. maybe.
But four days is nothing.  But I felt it was worth updating anyway.</p>
<p>The first couple days I didn't think anything of it.  Just started eating different foods.  Yesterday, day three, it hit me.  I wanted meat.  Maybe it's all mental, but I also wasn't feeling that well.  Not sick, but weak.  I talked to Kat and she asked what it is I have been eating.  Apparently the technique of replacing meat with tomatoes isn't going to work and explains my slight fatigue.  I currently have no protein in my diet and haven't had any for days.  I feel a little worse than I did yesterday, and I got a good night sleep and everything so I can only attribute it to that.  So it looks like I need to remedy this situation.</p>
<p>To go along with whatever it was I started feeling yesterday I also had my first meat craving.  Argh.  I wanted taco bell, I wanted wendys, I wanted everything.  It hit out of nowhere.  But I won't cave.  Oh no.  My guess the craving is because my body is pissed and requires something I refuse to put in it.  Anyone who said "I felt better the first week after removing meat from my diet" is lying.  They're a pretencious bastard who will try to make you feel bad for eating delicious murdered animals.  Don't listen to them.  mmmmm... murder.
Went to dinner with Kat last night to Noodles & Company.  Awesome.  I think i'll eat there a lot.  Most everything is without meat, but you add whatever meat you want to it.  I had a delicious thing that I didn't even know what it was and I didn't even miss the meat.</p>
<p>My fear is by the time I think I'm done with the experiment and I should eat meat again... I won't want to.  Oh god, what am I doing?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Pickles</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/12/pickles</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of last night, around 5pm I've cut out meat from my diet.  I've been planning this since around last night at 4:59pm or so.
It all started yesterday morning when Cassie and I were out to breakfast.  She convinced me to try a piece of egg, a food item I haven't had for about 15 years.  It's a slight phobia of cracking open the unfertilized birthplace of an animal.  I'm well aware egg is in pretty much everything, and that doesn't bother me.  I just don't want to look at it.
It was at dinner where I was looking at sauce options at spaghetti works and Cassie recommended I try the one without meat and I figured... why not.  Not only will I eat this without meat, I'm going to eat everything else without meat too.  Instead I can attempt to put things into my diet that I wouldn't normally eat.  So I made my order, and the waitress asked "Would you like a meatball with that?"  Bitch.
So it began, a spur of the moment decision impacting things I do every day.</p>
<p>I don't plan on doing this forever, but I see it as an experiment.  Can I start eating things I wouldn't normally eat because I've cut out the standards?  Will I feel better?  Will I lose weight?</p>
<p>Lunchtime comes today and I have to make a decision on what I'm to eat.  So I go to a local sandwich place by the office and for the first time in my life utter the words "veggie sub".  I even looked around to make sure nobody could hear me first.</p>
<p>He takes out some bread and layers with tomatoes.  I don't like tomatoes.  He looks at me and says "what else do you want on it?"  I look around and complete the sandwich with american cheese, onions, lettuce, oil and vinegar and finally pickles.  I brought it back to my desk and took a bite without even looking at it first.  First impression... i really like those pickles.</p>
<p>After work today i'm going to whole foods and see what I can try and hack together as far as grocery shopping.  I see veggie pizzas, noodles, pasta and bags of salad in my future.  Things I still don't have to figure out how to cook... but just things I already like that won't have meat in it.  I'm not trying to eat healthy... i'm just removing my default and still going to eat like crap.</p>
<p>I recalled the story to Cassie last night on how I started drinking only diet pop.  I stopped drinking regular pop for a whole year first and only drank water.  Once you lose your comparison then settling for something not as good is easy.  So I don't think you'll see me eating tofu anytime soon, but I'll stick to things that I'm already familiar with and in time i'll try eating things i'm not.  By that time I won't know any better?</p>
<p>Being this is an experiment I don't see it lasting more than a couple months unless my life dramatically changes for the better because of it.  I have no idea with slaughtering animals and then ripping the flesh off their tasty bones so i'm sure i'll be eating meat soon enough.  Besides Christmas is coming.. so that's a given.

      <title>25 things about me</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/01/25-things-about-me</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This note-writing meme has been going full force on Facebook lately.  I thought I'd cave and do it.  Since I did, I'll put it here as well.</p>
<p>Rules:<br />
Once you've been tagged, you are supposed to write a note with 25 random things, facts, habits, or goals about you. At the end, choose 25 people to be tagged. You have to tag the person who tagged you. If I tagged you, it's because I want to know more about you.</p>
<p>(To do this, go to "notes" under tabs on your profile page, paste these instructions in the body of the note, type your 25 random things, tag 25 people (in the right hand corner of the app) then click publish.)</p>
<p>1.  As a young boy I shot a squirrel for no reason.  I still feel bad about it.<br />
2.  I'm an activist for marriage reform.  Something with such a high failure rate obviously has a flaw.<br />
3.  A web app I once built was in PC World magazine as one of the "best of the web".  I was so proud.<br />
4.  I get upset when I have to use Windows at work.  It's like being tasked to cook a whole meal with only a lighter.<br />
5.  I love coffee.<br />
6.  People see me as young in Chicago, and old in Omaha.  Therefore I feel young in Chicago, and old in Omaha.<br />
7. Growing up I would perform at least two theatre shows a year, mostly musicals. I started at age seven with Fiddler on the Roof.<br />
8.  My favorite number is 8.<br />
9.  I respect people for their music taste more than I should.<br />
10. I'm an atheist, but I used to teach Sunday school in a Lutheran church.<br />
11. I started an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel that's been running for almost 15 years with many of the same people.<br />
12. I wish I could get into reading.  There's so much good content that I don't give myself access to.<br />
13. I would love to be a professional musician in some fashion.  But I know I'd never be good enough.<br />
14. I haven't had meat in almost two months.  I don't miss the food, I miss the convenience.<br />
15. Before I turned 18 I did a lot of not so legal things online. It allowed me to learn programming languages, operating systems and network topology in a way school never could.<br />
16. In high school I had a band that changed the lyrics of a song from "Tell me about the time you fucked your mother in your living room" to get a gig at a christian coffee house. We still never played there.<br />
17. I never saw someone use chewing tobacco until I met someone from Omaha.<br />
18. I once hosted a top ranked Podcast.  But I altered the rating system to rank us that way.<br />
19. I miss drumming.<br />
20. I once wanted to be a hobo. Given the options I thought it would be the most freeing and the best opportunity to start fresh.<br />
21. Being in a drum corps was some of the most fun I ever had.  Until I started to care more about winning.<br />
22. I swore off celebrating Christmas with my family after this past holiday.<br />
23. Without Twitter (and a couple other sites) i'd have no friends in Omaha.  I'm so thankful for the sites and the friends.<br />
24. I'm listening to The Cars - "Just what I needed" right now.<br />
25. I told myself I wouldn't do this, but after enough people tagged me, and reading Katie's, I figured I owed it to them. There's a lot my new friends don't know about me. This is like a cheat sheet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Happy 2009 everyone</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/01/happy-2009-everyone</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it was brought to my attention by one of my tweeple friends that I haven't blogged, specifically about the "no meat experiment" recently.  Since before Christmas.  So here it is!
Christmas was not fun.  And from now on i'm not going to celebrate it anymore.  Using vacation time to spend forced time with people i'm just not compatible with is just stupid to continue.  Guilt is not a "holiday spirit".  There's not much more to say about that.</p>
<p>However, Christmas was the first time I had unlimited meat choices to select from... and opted to have none of them.  I never mentioned it to anyone, I just didn't eat ham, or meatballs, or mini hotdogs, or anything.  I just stuck to everything else.  Nuts, veggies, cookies, pasta.  I just didn't care to have anything else.  I planned on eating at least the ham, but I just had no desire to when it came down to the execution of it.  Nobody but my Dad noticed, and that was for the best.  The last thing I wanted to talk about was removing meat from my diet and trying to justify myself.  Besides, I don't have a valid answer.</p>
<p>So now that I made it through Christmas... what next?</p>
<p>The first week back Cassie and I thought we'd do something crazy... go for Philly cheese steak sandwiches.  My first real time eating meat (aside from trying a piece of beef jerky once) and it didn't go as well as expected.  I got about half way through and I started feeling pretty lousy... my stomach was pissed.  I couldn't eat any more after that.  We had "light meat" on our cheeseburger pizza at the pizza shoppe last night and that was ok, but it was almost nothing.</p>
<p>People ask if i'm feeling any better or losing any weight.  No for both.  I had a bit where I felt pretty lousy at first, but I think my body was just going through a period of adjusting.  The stuff I relied on to live was removed.  But now, I feel the same as if I was eating meat, but I'm just a lot more frustrated when finding meals.  But maybe I just haven't given it enough chance.  I'll keep up with it until I don't want to anymore.</p>
<p>Kat took me to McFosters, an all meatless restaraunt and it was awesome.  You don't have to find something to eat.. you can eat anything.  It was nice to see and I'd like to go there often.
My goal of being less red meat dependent I think has not come to fruition.  If I were to put meat back in my diet today it would be a flood of hamburgers and tacos.  For all I know i'd be worse than before and just binge on cow.</p>
<p>So that's that.  I still don't eat meat.  And I haven't died from it yet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Hello from Chicago</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/01/hello-from-chicago</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I dragged Cassie (well actually she drove most of the way) to Chicago this week.  Been here since Tuesday night, and it's really nice to see the city again.</p>
<p>It is a little eye opening though.  Living here for so long, then going elsewhere, and then coming back.</p>
<p>All the odd looks and questions when I say I really do like Omaha, and i'm not just saying that to back myself up in the move.  All the logistics to do things and meet up with people. </p>
<p>I haven't used the CTA much at all, really ever.  A little here and there to go from place A to place B, but I pretty much drove myself everywhere.  I don't have a car here now, and I feel pretty stupid when Cassie gives me a look like "shouldn't you know this stuff?"  But I don't.  I'm not a CTA user.  I know how it works, I know how to get to simple point to point things if I plan out the line ahead of time, but that's about it.  So this trip is certainly overshadowed by her thinking i'm an idiot and I think she'd have more fun if I wasn't here.  That really bums me out to know you're holding someone back.  Especially when you thought you were doing something nice.  It sucks to to feel not good enough.</p>
<p>On a side note, my friend Corinne just moved to Chicago.  Go to her web site.  Follow her on Twitter, become her new Chicago friend.  She's fun.  Link = <a href="http://kandy.net/index.php">Krin!</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Irregardless, it's time to cowboy up</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/01/irregardless-its-time-to-cowboy-up</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I haven't blogged anything about my job since I've moved to Omaha I don't think.  Well, here's my first.Met our new "uber manager" today, or the manager of my manager.  Let me put it simply, i'm scared shitless.  I can't think of someone I can relate to any less.</p>
<p>For hobbies, it's Huskers football.  He also likes to fish and cook game.  He said the word "irregardless" and told us to "cowboy up".  I don't even know what "cowboy up" means and I refuse to google it.</p>
<p>He's pretty hardcore and has pretty rough expectations of our teams.  That's fine.  But seriously, I think he's the reason there's a sign on our building that says "firearms are not allowed here."  I think he'd use shotguns to threaten our lives.</p>
<p>He's the first guy in management I've ever met, anywhere, that has specificly told us not to go to him if there's an issue.  You can only go to your direct manager, and if you ever want to talk to him... you have to tell your management first to tell him that you're going to be talking to him.  I've never ever heard of anyone less accessible in my life.</p>
<p>I'm really not sure what to think.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>And now I own an iPhone</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/02/and-now-i-own-an-iphone</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an avid mac enthusiast you probably just assume I've had an iPhone since the first version of the device was launched.  You'd be wrong.</p>
<p>I've been using a Treo650 on Sprint for many years.  Before that, the Treo600.  Before that a Treo 300.  When I started using a QWERTY phone T9 wasn't even invented yet.</p>
<p>My Treos over the years have been nothing less than a faithful companion.  PalmOS has let me select from a wealth of applications, both free and paid, that help me do anything I needed.  IRC, IM, better email than a blackberry (IMAP IDLE).  I used it as a time tracker when I was a consultant.  I used it as a Twitter device.  I used it for everything.  Games, tools, utilities.  SSH, FTP, RDP and VPN are all stupid acronyms that have been taken place within my Palm-based phones.</p>
<p>A few too many drops casued some of the keys on my Treo650 to finally give out.  I take my mobile devices seriously so the idea of having a broken yet usable phone didn't appeal to me.  It was time to make the jump.</p>
<p>Before I knew it I was on the Apple web site filling out a form.  They were getting me an AT&T account, I didn't have to set foot in anything branded with them... it was awesome.  I finished up the form online with it finally asking me what time i'd like to be at the Apple Store, I said 11:30.  I went durring lunch and they knew who I was when walking in the door.  "Can I help you?"  "Yes, I'm here for my iPhone."  "Oh you must be Gabe, we have everything ready for you."</p>
<p>A guy then walked through verifying everything I typed in online, took my credit card, and I walked out with an activated iPhone.  Done.  It was really that easy.</p>
<p>I'm still getting used to the thing.  It's not easy to type on.  But others got used to it, and so will I.  Now I just need a case for it.</p>
<p>Here's my iPhone home screen:<br />

<p>I had to to go back to my SMS aggrigator service today and purchase more SMS outbound credits since the 400 I originally purchased were all used up.  But that means it's being used, but that also means it's not exactly financially supportible by myself.  I'll worry about that later like any good service.  I might just use Twitter direct messages instead of SMS.  That's free, but not as nice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I'm going to make a thing for twitter</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/02/im-going-to-make-a-thing-for-twitter</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who knows me knows I'm addicted to Twitter.  I won't go into details of my love affair with the beautiful beast, but let's just say it's a pretty integrated part of my lifestyle work flow.
However, there's things I wish it did that it doesn't do.  It's not very flexible.</p>
<p>For example, you can send tweets from people you follow to your phone via SMS, and that's a great feature.  But sometimes I only want things sent to my phone that I care about.  So you have two options.  When you make a tweet, and someone replies... you either don't see it while you're mobile, or you turn on mobile updates and see everything just in case someone replies to you.
In my case the third option is to every once in a while check the mobile twitter site and see if anyone has said anything, but sometimes you may get a @message without expecting it... you won't know that even happened until you check the web site later.  All those options suck in my opinion.</p>
<p>So that's when I took it upon myself to build a service called "Tweply" that simply looks at your incoming tweets and text's them to you if it's something you're looking for.  That way you can tweet via sms, and get replies to that tweet via sms without being completely immersed, or completely shut out.</p>
<p>That's where the story should end.  Damnit.</p>
<p>But now I decided to turn it into a service tha others can use.  There's probably others that want to see just @replies to tweets they've sent as well when mobile.</p>
<p>I'm not planning on going crazy with this, but who knows.  The game plan is this:</p>
<p>Web page.  You put in your twitter credentials (sorry, but that's how twitter rolls... ).  You then put in what string you're looking for (generally will be @username, but whatever), and the method you want to be notified of it.  Eithier SMS or email.  I guess there will be a thing where you can turn it on and off too.  Every 5min or so you'll get a notification if someone replies.</p>
<p>However, there's still time for someone to talk me out of this.  Any takers?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tweply - since nobody talked me out of it</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/02/tweply-since-nobody-talked-me-out-of-it</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was hoping someone would talk me out of another stupid idea.  Damn you all.
So this is what you get.  An alpha thingy of Tweply.  <a title="http://www.real-ity.com/tweply/" href="http://www.real-ity.com/tweply/">http://www.real-ity.com/tweply/</a></p>
<p>No promises how well it'll work, but it should work ok.  It looks ugly.  Well.. actually it looks more like nothing.  That's how my design skills are.  Couple header tags, a center, some text and not close out the body.</p>
<p>Again, you have to give out your twitter password to use it.  But that's how all twitter app things work.  Hopefully they'll build an API that would allow 3rd party services login without having plain text credentials.  That'd be cool.</p>
<p>So try it out, use it for good things. Let me know any changes you'd like to see.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Alright, I'll blog.  Leave me alone about it.</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/03/alright-ill-blog-leave-me-alone-about-it</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's a really exciting time right now. It's South by Southwest conference/festival time! And you know as well as I do what that means! Nothing.</p>
<p>I get really bitter this time every year. All the professional "consultants", "media experts", and "freelancers" all converge in Texas to talk about awesome things. While us lame kids with corporate jobs sit in our cubes and listen to them talk about how much fun they're having.</p>
<p>It's probably just jealousy. But I also think it's nothing more than a circle jerk. A circle jerk I'd love to go to. But unfortunately that's not my scene and not meant to be.</p>
<p>On the home front, there's plenty other stuff going on. I got to see Richard Dawkins speak the other day. That, in itself, was a mind blowing, possibly once in a lifetime experience. However, the situation around it set off nothing more than a chain reaction of events that led me to lose the person closest to me here in Omaha.</p>
<p>I won't go through details, but the self-realization surrounding my relationship with her became clear and I had to make decisions. I really, really wish it could be different. But I'll eventually move on, it'll just take a while. It's hard that the one special person i've had since I've moved here is now gone.</p>
<p>On the bright side of the week, I saw Har Mar Superstar last night. He put on an awesome show. Just really badass. It was full of new material that was great, I can't wait for his new album. Plus I hung out with him outside for a while just chatting. Turns out he comes to Omaha a lot and really likes it here. Cool.</p>
<p>Hope your week was better than mine. Stay r33t.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tweply and SMS</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/03/tweply-and-sms</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy post Saint Patrick's day.
So maybe I was optimistic (or pessimistic, depending on how you see it) about Tweply and SMS functionality.  Like other projects I've thrown  together I felt a need that I couldn't find elsewhere, and then offered it to others.  Except this time it's costing me more than I expected with people signing up for it.</p>
<p>I love that people find it useful, but unfortunately I'm paying much more than I expected.</p>
<p>So the other day I added Direct Message support.  This allows you to get your Tweply notification using Twitter as the notification method.  Make sure Twitter is sending DMs to your phone and you're good to go.</p>
<p>All you have to do to make this work is delete your old Tweply watch and create a new one using your username as the alert method.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions.  At some point down the road I'll probably disable SMS notification all together, but I want to make sure I have the proper options in place so people can still use the service the way they want to.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Be at Big Omaha May 7th and 8th.  Seriously.</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/04/big-omaha</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bigomaha.com"><img title="bigomaha" height="188" alt="bigomaha" width="254" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-846" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a205e4b0fd42afd19ff0/1355981317989/?format=original" /></a>
Big Omaha is coming up.  It's really your last chance right now to get tickets.</p>
<p>I'd really love to try and convince you to go, but at this point, if this is your kind of thing... you're already not willing to miss it.  However, if you're out of town, out of state... whatever, this is a GREAT chance to visit the amazing city of Omaha.  Seriously.  Get a ticket, and get your ass here.  Omaha is going to be the center of the creative world for two days and I would hate for anyone to miss it.  Unfortunately, many will.</p>
<p>So I'm not going to get on my soap box and tell you why you should go or what great things are going to come out of it.  I'm only going to tell you that if you're at all interested, and you don't go, you're going to feel really left out.  That's all.</p>
<p>So hit up <a href="http://www.bigomaha.com">bigomaha.com</a> and hurry to get your ticket before they're all sold out.  Exciting stuff, people.  Some socks will be rocked.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Next step... there is no next step.  Yet.</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/04/next-step</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love hearing people's plans for the future.  If they're graduating from college, or just have their first real job and have big plans... hearing that stuff is cool.  Having vision and goals are what keep people alive.  You need to be driven to continue to do something.  A stagnant life isn't really  life at all.
I've been thinking about that a lot lately.  What is my next step?  And I don't mean personally, or professionally.  But something of both.  It shouldn't really be that separate.  Thinking of yourself as two halfs is really a shame.  To think you have to live two lives that cannot intersect is limiting your potential.</p>
<p>But that's kind of where I am.  Personally, I'm confident I live in one of the best cities in the world, surrounded by some of the most talented, influential, and intelligent people I've ever met.  This is not an overstatement.  I have friends who make things, who write things, who organize things, who turn dreams into reality.  They make things happen, and they're damn good at it.  I am absolutely honored.</p>
<p>Professionally, I have an awesome job a ton of people would love to have.  Seriously.  I make things happen at a multi zillion dollar company.  I get paid well, I have good benefits.  I would completely look up to myself if I met myself while younger.</p>
<p>But there's a sense of synergy that is missing.  The sum of my parts equal exactly how the math says it should.  But damnit, I want more.</p>
<p>This is a common theme with me.  If you've known me any length of time I'm rarely satisfied.  I thought for the longest time it was just because it was simply that, I'd never be satisfied.  But after making major changes, I see major changes.  Who knew?</p>
<p>Professionally I'm kind of where I wanted to be.  So my vision and goals professionally aren't there.  What do you do when you're doing what you wanted to do?  Maybe I just never had lofty enough goals.  I never wanted to be president, or an astronaut.  I wanted to be a badass IT guy.  Sure, I learn more every day, and I will always continue to grow.  But again, I'm rarely satisfied.  I always need something to work towards.</p>
<p>I only start thinking about all this stuff when my two halfs start to actively start fighting each other.  It's one thing if 1+1=2, but it's another when 1+1 &lt; 2.  I've had more and more reactions at work that are similar to "Oh come on.  I didn't have any problem with this kind of stuff, but now you're just pissing me off."  And that sucks.  Little jab after little jab.  It bothers me only because I liked it when I was content.  But new management and increased scrutiny change how/when/where we perform our jobs.  But that's the corporate world . They squeeze and squeeze until some things slip out of their hand, but still have a much tighter grip on what is left.</p>
<p>Again, not complaining.  But sometimes things are enlightening.  I want 1+1 &gt;= 3.</p>
<p>I'd love to have a conversation with those that can relate, or have have posed similar questions to themselves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I completely feel you on this one, Gabe! You put it very well. This is exactly how I&#39;ve been thinking lately.<br><br>I have plans, goals, ambitions, projects, and a lot of exciting ideas, but the knowledge of where I want to go, where I will go, and what the next steps are is still to be determined. For a while, that actually worried me and stressed me out. However, lately I&#39;m learning to really let go, take risks, and not wear myself out chasing things too hard. There really seems to be almost a beautiful serenity to knowing, yet not knowing how or where. It seems that things happen for the willing. It&#39;s encouraging to know that being willing is really all it takes!<br><br>I&#39;ve got this growing sense of realization combined with desire. I realize that I can create my life, and affect the lives of others. I can build my world, and shape our world. I&#39;m not sure if this realization created the strong desire to do it or if it was the other way, but I know its a cyclical system that I wouldn&#39;t dream of breaking! It seems like when you&#39;re open to inspiration and answers, they come. It&#39;s really amazing. ("When the student is ready, the teacher will appear") I&#39;m reading tons of great books lately and even get inspiration from unexpected places all the time.<br><br>I also hear you on the tech. thing. I knew when I was about 8 or 9 that I wanted to program, &#39;hack the planet&#39;, and design things. I grew up to do just that, which I&#39;m glad about, but there is almost an emptiness left from realizing a goal is met. I&#39;ve started to realize that if I can really develop and hone skills in other areas, I can start taking my development and creation to a new level and building working business systems, new skillsets, relationships, and the general lifestyle I want to create. It&#39;s exciting, because it felt for awhile that I couldn&#39;t go much further. There will always be a new coding language to learn, but realistically they&#39;re all a variant of the same basic structure and are more increasingly framework based, which I hate. If a new language presents less of a challenge, why do it? And why learn another when you can write it in one, you know?<br><br>One of the things that really made me think about creating my own lifestyle and realizing that endless possibilities are open to me is the book "The Four Hour Work Week"  by Tim Ferris. I honestly think you would love this book. If you do wind up reading it, I&#39;d love to know what your thoughts are on the ideas in it.<br><br>I&#39;m still hashing out the details of what I want, but I&#39;ve really started focusing on creating the elements within my life to create a totally harmonious and balanced life. Singular life -- infinite value! I also love hearing about the goals other people have and what they&#39;re doing to get there. How about you? Are new goals emerging for you as well?</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Tweetup #4</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/04/tweetup4</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Omaha Tweetup #4 is over.  All together, not bad.  But certainly the curve his heading downward in the "coolness" chart.
It seems as it gets more successful, in better venues, the less charm the event has.</p>
<p>The first tweetup had about 40 people there.  It's the first time I met a lot of great people.  Not only people I'd start following on Twitter for the first time, but people that are now friends of mine.  I can't say the same has happened at any of the other tweetups.</p>
<p>Last night there was so much space, so comfortable of a venue, that it's easy for people to stand/sit/hide in their respective groups.  You're not forced into a corner with strangers.  A part of the reason I initially started introducing myself the first time around is the fact that you look stupid standing by yourself in front of everybody.  Last night it was perfectly OK to be by yourself, nobody would notice.  And aside from the name tags (that some may not even be wearing), you could just be a normal Nomad frequenter.  You're not embarrassed into awesomeness.</p>
<p>Ideas to resolve this?  Food, of course.  Put up a table with snacks or <a href="http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=135876">pizza</a>.  That gets people to all congregate around a single location in a venue and even by accident start talking to people.  And even though I really do like Nomad, it's a great place, it just had the feeling of a night out having drinks with friends.  Well, aside from the business card pushers anyway.</p>
<p>(Photos by @<a href="http://twitter.com/programmerman">programmerman</a>)</p>
<p>When the Tweetup came to an end for <a href="http://twitter.com/k_to_the_t">KT</a> and I she came up with this crazy idea to pick up some stranger that she knew off of twitter and head to the 49r.  So we did.</p>
<p>I tweeted later "<a href="http://twitter.com/gabek/status/1488397750">The tweetup isn't over, it's just not going on there anymore</a>", and it was true.  We were having a blast.  KT eventually left and our new friend, the previously unfollowed by me, @<a href="http://twitter.com/kfred85">kfred85</a>, and I kept drinking and then went for pizza.  The night ended around 1:30am.</p>
<p>Tweetup?  meh.  Alternative Tweetup.  Rockin'.</p>
<p>On a side note, there needs to be a term for "alternative tweetup".  I don't know what that is.  AlternaTweetup is too long.  TweetAlt?  Twalt?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Welcome to the new face of Gabe</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/04/welcome</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real-ity.com has a long standing history.  One that I don't take lightly.
"Gabe's Digital Life v3.1337" at real-ity.com was born five or so years ago.  Before that it was another, much more simple blog.  And before that, collections of links.  This dating all the way back to 1997.  As my friend BobbyT once said, "I was blogging since it was just called updating a web site."</p>
<p>But with the culture of the internet as it is, I felt the need to change with it.  My moniker, Real-ity, is no longer how I need to be identified online.  Even though still a valid piece of my personality, Real-ity is no longer the public facing identity for me.</p>
<p>So this new website is me, Gabe.  And everything I do online will show up here.  Twitter, videos, music.  Not a ton different than the content that was available before, but I hope to make it a bit more accessible</p>
<p>I'm a little tired, and blabbing... but I felt the need when I came home tonight to blog and say a little something about this new piece o' web that I've claimed.</p>
<p>Thank you for checking it out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A goodbye to an old friend</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/05/a-goodbye-to-an-old-friend</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>This post was originally published at <a href="http://www.channelomaha.com/live/co/68">ChannelOmaha.com</a> where Gabe is a guest blogger.</i></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of a more inappropriate first blog to ChanelOmaha.com than a story about how I traveled to Kansas City.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s just how this is going to be.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night I traveled to Kansas City to say goodbye to an old friend.</p>
<p>I arrived, got comfortable, and heard him tell the same stories he&#8217;s told so many times before.&nbsp; But this time he was a little more jovial, just a little less stone cold serious.&nbsp; But each tale still had the complete power and inspiration as every time he told it before.&nbsp; I still was able to mouth the words with him, as I&#8217;ve heard the stories so many times.</p>
<p>Of course I&#8217;m talking about seeing Nine Inch Nails perform in Kansas City.&nbsp; From the t-shirts saying &quot;Wave Goodbye&quot; to Trent closing his show with &quot;Hurt&quot; instead of something like &quot;Closer&quot;, it was nothing less than an old friend giving a large collective hug and saying &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>For those who&#8217;ve seen Trent and Company perform before, this wasn&#8217;t like previous tours.&nbsp; No video screens.&nbsp; No lasers.&nbsp; No special effects.&nbsp; Just some guys on stage, a fog machine, and some of the best music ever made.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t play a lot of what many fans call &quot;the new stuff.&quot;&nbsp; And to me, that was a downer.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t recall anything from Ghosts being played.&nbsp; But it seemed to work.&nbsp; This is Trent&#8217;s goodbye, and from the crowd screaming the lyrics it got a lot quieter during &quot;Discipline&quot; and &quot;Echoplex&quot; anyway.&nbsp; But like any other NIN show the place erupted with &quot;Sin&quot;, &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Head like a hole.&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of a better way to say goodbye to an old friend than how I did Wednesday night.</p>

      <title>How to communicate, by Gary Vaynerchuk</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/05/gabeandgary</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What great conversation between Gary Vaynerchuk, the internet and I today.  There's something invigorating about a really constructive conversation where you come out of it feeling better about the topic than when you went in.  While it's a great business and brand technique, the world would in general be a much better place if it happened more often.
Gary reached out to me after reading my blog post that I had Alex (@alexpgates) check out, and wanted to clear up any miscommunication with me, and everyone else on how he's seen or interpreted.</p>
<p>I probably came off harsh on my post.  Few can deny that Gary is not only a very talented salesman of wine, but also a successful brand consultant and inspiring speaker.  While his ideas are great, and probably very likely to succeed, if you're watching his video, and you have ideas yourself... yours probably are great as well.  I promise I'll take my own advice someday soon :)</p>
<p>Thanks Gary, you're a good guy.  And that's meant outside of any speaker/consultant/expert role that you fill.  Being a good person will always be what matters in the end.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Agreed, Gary is a great person! At the South Beach afterparty for FOWA Miami 2008, my buddy (now business partner) and I were by ourselves, and Gary came right up and talked to us for a few minutes. There were plenty of other Internet celebs around (Kevin Rose for example) that he could have chilled with the whole night, but he came up and talked with "the nobodies" - That&#39;s REAL.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>My BIG post on BIGOmaha</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/05/my-big-post-on-bigomaha</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm not going to talk about what Big Omaha was, or was not in the "Big Omaha brought the counties best and brightest creative blah blah blah" type thing.   I'm not going to write much about what the speakers had to say.   I'm going to tell my tale of the first ever Big Omaha conference and the parts that mattered to me.  This will probably be long and spread with random photos.
Everyone knows I was excited.   If you were to ask me why, I'd be completely honest and tell you that I didn't know.   I even posted a video for Big Omaha's use explaining that It's going to be great, and I won't be able to tell you why until Friday night.  Friday night came and went, and now I can tell you why it was awesome.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3516453470_9cefcd695c.jpg?v=0"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3516453470_9cefcd695c.jpg?v=0" alt="" width="154" height="108" /></a>It was the perfect mix of new and "old" friends.  You know I'm going to have a great time hanging out with people like KT and Lasertron.   I'll always have some great tech conversations with Matt and Corey.  But the new faces were awesome.  I finally met Chris Rich, I've only known him from Twitter since forever.  Met Steff Childs at Slowdown at the kickoff party.  A handful of KC'ers were around that I got to meet.  While at the awesome What Cheer / Secret Penguin party Thursday night I met Jolie O'Dell because of a tweet she sent out.  Now I have a crush on her, I won't lie.   I also met a new friend, LeAnn, who now hangs in #TheCabin... so that's a big win there.  Jimmy Winter introducted himself to me and we had a chat while waiting in line for beer.  By the way, the beer line is a huge opportunity to meet people.  Man, I met so many awesome people.  I can't really go on any longer just listing them... but seriously.  Cool.</p>
<p>Thursday night was the kick-off party featuring Gary Vaynerchuk.  Anyone who knows me knows I'm not a fan of Gary.   There's a ton to like, and he's one inspiring bastard, but there's one reason I can't click with him.   He positions himself differently online than he does in person.   During his talk on Friday he said he doesn't have the answers, and he told the story that worked for him, and all he can do is hope you'll find what works for you.   But online he positions himself as a role model with all the answers, when in reality: he's a wine salesman.   When he gives an idea online, <a href="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs011.snc1/2902_92703702585_503272585_2603644_8090153_n.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs011.snc1/2902_92703702585_503272585_2603644_8090153_n.jpg" alt="" width="103" height="77" /></a>many people jump at it believing that his spontaneous ideas are somehow better than their own.   And I think Gary would be the first to agree that it's not cool.   After seeing him in person he wants people to succeed based on what they want, not because they copy verbatim what he has to say.     I really believe he means well, but it's hard to be an online personality, and also say "I have no idea" at the same time.<a href="http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3745/192/20/503272585/n503272585_2603673_485430.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3745/192/20/503272585/n503272585_2603673_485430.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="174" /></a></p>
<p>I only bring this up because during the awesome speaker panel he told the crowd to quit college, and it's an outdated institution that is "going down".   Jason Fried said it's the next big bubble to burst.  <a href="http://twitter.com/gabek/status/1740380641">I sent out a tweet</a> saying it's probably the first thing I've ever agreed with coming from Gary.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/garyvee/status/1740494979">Gary replied via twitter with a smile</a>.   He then mentioned my comment during his talk saying he's bummed when people have problems with him.  I found him at the party that night he looked like he had his plate full,  so I left it at that.   So all in all, I learned Gary Vaynerchuk is human.  But I still think he's a salesman who doesn't have the answers.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3745/192/20/503272585/n503272585_2603685_3174413.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3745/192/20/503272585/n503272585_2603685_3174413.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="105" /></a>I also found Micah Baldwin to be way cooler than when  I checked him out online.   His personality and stories were infectious.   He was completely honest about things that have happened in his life to bring him to his point.   Things like "you have to wake up in a pool of your own vomit" really made him personable.   We then connected over Twitter that night, and I met him in person at the Tweetup Saturday morning.   Very glad to come out feeling like I met someone who is really a good person and doing well in the space we're all interested in.</p>
<p>Other highlights of the actual conference?  Seeing my good friends Megan and Kt up on stage representing Omaha's chapter of Girls in Tech.  That was seriously great.  Also the presentation from Ben Rattray from Change.org, I expected to be "do your part to help blah blah", while a great message, wasn't what I was there for; it ended up being a "do something that matters, make it <a href="http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3745/192/20/503272585/n503272585_2603665_8134554.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3745/192/20/503272585/n503272585_2603665_8134554.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="139" /></a>important".  What a kick in the ass.  The slide that says "Are you working on the most important problem you can think of?" made my jaw drop.  No matter how important your corporate management thinks your job is, it isn't.  Another slide saying "If your company was gone tomorrow, would anyone notice?" was another question.  I answer "NO" to both of those questions.  And so begins the journey to make my life worthwhile and do something to enrich the world.</p>
<p>Another great surprise were the sponsor presentations.  I thought Yahoo! would be full of "Hi, we're yahoo.  Let me tell you why you should use our search engine.  Now look at Flickr, cool huh?"  It turned out to be this great guy, Micah Laaker, who is originally from Omaha, presenting all the APIs and developer tools Yahoo offers.  I learned a lot.  I met him at the Girls in Tech party and we chatted for a while.  I told him about how some of the tools I've used in projects, and some I've never even heard of and was thankful he was there to tell me about them.  A really great guy.  Another high point was the local Omaha panel where we saw the co-founder of Saddle Creek records, the person who runs Film Streams, the guy who started Nomad, etc.  How cool is that.  Local success stories from people that matter.</p>
<p>But I'm being long winded.  So let me narrow this down.  The quality was 150%.  Every detail from the coffee cups, to the VIP lanyards, the signs for the bathrooms, the lunch, the sponsors for the parties... everything.  Top of the line in every single way.  The speakers, where I expected them to be cocky "I'm important and let me tell you how to do things" type of personalities turned out to be completely different.  They were fun, intriguing, and approachable.  They wanted to be there, and they all wanted to meet you.  Most of them even gave out their personal telephone numbers to *everyone* who attended.  (Micah Baldwin gave out his mom's too.  I got her voicemail.)</p>
<p>There's one hundred things I missed talking about, but that's ok.  Anyone who was there experienced it, and anyone who wasn't has a glimpse into the first ever Big Omaha conference.  What a wild ride.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Dood, It is so cool that you prompted a conversation about, what I think, is one of today&#39;s most important subjects - communicating.  Being able to have a productive conversation is so important in this new (social/transparent) world.  And, obviously, it is still very important in business.  I love that we got to talk in Big Omaha and I thought it was cool for you to use twitter/tweetups to meet new people and make new friends.  You proved that you are already a great communicator.  Keep it up and I wish you all the best.<br><br>Jason</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Gabe,<br><br>Dude. Great meeting you back in Omaha, and I really enjoyed our chat. Glad to hear I could humanize Yahoo!&#39;s developer outreach efforts. Our whole group is made of folks who are really passionate about empowering anyone on the Web to build innovative products. So while I *do* like Yahoo! Search and Flickr, I&#39;m equally excited about what others are building (whether using our tools, others&#39;, or on their own). Definitely stay in touch here... would love to see what your next project is. (Btw, Tweply looks nice.)<br><br>Glad we had the chance to meetup. cheers, -micah!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>A quick catch-up post</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/05/quick-catch-up</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I opened my blog editor here with an idea of what to post.  Then I got side tracked, and I no longer remember what it was I planned on talking about.  So instead this is just going to be a catch-up post.  Sorry about that.
I bought a new camera the other day.  With BIGOmaha coming up I needed a way to document the event, so off to Nebraska Furniture Mart I went.  I came out with a Canon SX200.</p>
<p><a href="http://photocapture.ru/uploads/posts/2009-02/1235107191_canon_sx200is.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://photocapture.ru/uploads/posts/2009-02/1235107191_canon_sx200is.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>I liked it because it has a really big lens.  The optical zoom is crazy good for a point and shoot.  Those are my big complaints with most cameras.  Who cares how many megapixels it can capture if the camera isn't really seeing them well?  And zoom on point and shoots is really limited, instead falling into "digital zoom" territory.  Digital zoom should just be called "crap mode".  This beast fixes those issues.  Plus it captures video in 720p HD, 16:9 aspect ratio.  In a point and shoot.  It's a little bigger than most people would like, but I don't care.  I just want quality without knowing how to use it.  I believe I got that.</p>
<p>Next topic.  I'm making my first trip to Kansas City tomorrow with @<a href="http://twitter.com/andrea_joi">Andrea_Joi</a>.  She got free tickets to The Killers and asked if I'd like to come.  So off we go tomorrow to some random city in some random state I've never been to.  I expect big things, though.  People here seem to piss themselves over Kansas City.  Maybe because they have an NFL team.  Valid.</p>
<p>In other news, BIGOmaha next week!  If you're not excited about it, it's because you're not going.  In fact I believe I'll be getting my invite to the <a href="http://girlsintech.net/">Girls in Tech</a> party here shortly.  15 tickets remaining as of this writing.</p>
<p>The first automated #retweet_thursday on Twitter was nothing short of completely annoying yesterday.  Success.  Feel free to follow @<a href="http://twitter.com/RT_Thursday">RT_Thursday</a>.  But I highly recommend that you don't.</p>
<p>Yesterday was my two year anniversary with my company.  Even though I had a couple years working for them on top of that via consulting that never counted.  Oh well.</p>
<p>My parents are coming to visit Omaha on the 15th.  Aside from the Zoo or whatever I don't really know what to show them that's of much interest to them.  I love the city, but it's not much for a couple day visitation.</p>
<p>Hope everyone had a great week and a better weekend.  See you soon, talk to you sooner.</p>

      <title>Where friendship and responsibility collides in a community</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/05/responsibility-and-friends</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the years I've had this blog I've rearely talked about the nitty-gritty of running an IRC channel.  In theory, there's not much to it.  But in reality, it's a community of people, many who have been there for many, many years.
This is where a large group of my friends are.  All types of people from all over the world.</p>
<p>But lately the topic of respect and seniority has been brought up more and more often.  Why certain people have different levels of privileges than others.  Those who are asking, and feel they deserve the elevated rights state loyalty and seniority as the reason for it.  But I feel very differently, and I wanted to discuss it here.  I'm probably not the only one who has encountered these issues in whatever type of community they happen to run.</p>
<p>I have the highest respect for those who have been a party of a community for an extended length of time.  In fact, any group of people would just slowly disappear if people didn't stick around.  So that's common sense, you need a core group of people that you know will be around.  It makes it more comfortable for new people knowing that if the group has been there that long, then it must be something special.</p>
<p>But I personally see a very distinct difference between quantity and quality.  Especially online you know the difference between people who "use" something, and who "take part" in something.  On digg.com there's people who use it to see what stuff is popular and go and read it.  And then there's people who go out and find new stuff and submit it to the site.  On twitter there's people who only follow celebrities and read what they have to say, and then there's people who submit 140 character pieces of content to keep the community alive.  The examples can go on and on.  There's people who use it, and there's people who are it.</p>
<p>On IRC it's no difference.  We have people who run the web site, we have people who run the wiki, we have people who take care of the bot, host podcasts, etc etc etc.  There's been so many things over the years that people have stepped up and said "I can take care of that for us."  While there's people who have been there 15yrs and never once even logged into the wiki to update their profile page, or used the website for anything.  Those are two completely different groups of people.  While giving elevated privileges to the people who have been loyal members of the community for many years, they never earned it.  Never made an attempt, never even showed interest.</p>
<p>This is an issue for me.  As both groups of people are my friends.  All who are long-time friends and I care about.  The question becomes am I willing to to please a friend, and gift them with something that shows I respect them while at the same time disrespecting the community as a whole and how it operates?  My answer I determined was no.  I'm not.  This hurts people, and that really sucks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Six months of being an Omahan ( #bigomaha )</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/05/six-months-of-being-an-omahan-bigomaha</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So this week marks six months of living in Omaha.
I can't help but look back to a <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2008/08/hellooooo-omaha">simple blog post I made on August 1st, 2008</a>.  I wrote  "Do I want to move to Omaha?  Not really."  Now flash forward to May 2009 where my journey in Omaha has so little to do with the reason I came here in the first place.</p>
<p>It's mostly about the people for me.  From the second I stepped foot on Omaha's soil it's been a non-stop experience of meeting the greatest people ever.</p>
<ul>
<li>I land in October, to visit.  I immediately get a text message from <a href="http://www.narcissica.com/">Jess</a>, "Welcome to Omaha."  From that moment I never felt more welcome somewhere.</li>
<li>A couple days later <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sccrgrl2002">Jillian </a>helps me find a place to live in Dundee.</li>
<li><a href="http://smellypuppy.com/">Boutcher </a>introduces me to everyone at the office and invites me to a party thrown by <a href="http://www.phildietz.com">Phil</a>.</li>
<li>I meet <a href="http://twitter.com/geekyfemme">Kat </a>for coffee and I'm glad to know someone who wants to talk geekery with me.  She introduces me to drag queens.</li>
<li>I meet Cassie who shows me how the city likes to have fun and in turn I get to show her how Chicago does when we visit my friends there.</li>
<li>At my first Tweetup I introduce myself to the infamous <a href="http://twitter.com/k_to_the_t">KT</a>, who has since become a very close friend and a source of inspiration both socially and professionally.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=63209123&amp;ref=mf">Andrea </a>becomes my partner in crime any time either of us want to go out, or there's a show.</li>
<li>I meet <a href="http://www.dustyd.net/">Dusty</a> <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/">and</a> <a href="http://www.slobotski.com/">Jeff </a>who show me that I can be a part of something in Omaha that would never be possible in Chicago.</li>
<li>Becoming friends with <a href="http://twitter.com/incognito1027">Christin </a>makes me realize that I can share things and be important to someone else's life just like so many have become important to mine.</li>
<li>I learn when I go out with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=63202841&amp;ref=mf">Terah</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/obrewan">Bree</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/valerienoelle">Valerie </a>there's going to be some awesome tunes played on the jukebox.  We'll sing "Tom Sawyer" multiple times.</li>
<li>I become a real part of a neighborhood.  Knowing if I go to "my bar", <a href="http://www.myspace.com/49rlounge">The 49r</a>, I'll see people I recognize.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kandy.net/">Krin </a>sucks because she moved to Chicago.  Wish she could have stuck around longer.</li>
<li>In no other world would <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1545495035&amp;ref=mf">Schaft</a>, otherwise just "the bartender",  be a friend of mine outside of a pint of Boulevard.</li>
<li>I can walk to "my coffee shop" and see that <a href="http://www.princesslasertron.com/">Megan </a>is just down the street.  I can go say hi and <a href="http://twitter.com/lasertron/status/1689301321">share some ice cream and conversation</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/bspersonal">Brian</a> shows me how fun and awkward it could be for a few guys who have no clue what they're doing to <a href="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2601/128/113/690609344/n690609344_1441636_7322896.jpg"> throw themselves into the public promotions game</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/daveloyall">Dave </a>and <a href="http://twitter.com/secos">Matt </a>help me debug issues with my web site on IRC.  The difference here is I know I'll see them in a couple days and I'll buy them a beer to thank them.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bigomaha.com">BigOmaha</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There's so many other people, places, and experiences that I'm missing.  But this isn't meant to be some kind of all encompassing list of everyone that I know.  Just a snapshot of some really important people that have made the six months probably the best six months of my life.</p>
<p>Thanks, Omaha.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Closest friends of Gabe #tweetdinner</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/06/closest-friends-of-gabe-tweetdinner</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm certainly on a kick lately of wanting to take part in some social experimentation.  So when this idea came to mind, I couldn't pass it up.
The other day I jumped on a new Tweeter stats type thing.  There's hundreds of them.  This one is twitteranalyzer.com.  After it analyzed my online social circle it determined who my "closest friends" were.  Although all awesome people, they're not the people I've spent the most time with.  But I guess in the twitter world it meant that we had the most to/from conversations.</p>
<p>This list turned out to be @<a href="http://twitter.com/nickashley">nickashley</a>, @<a href="http://twitter.com/kfred85">kfred85</a> and @<a href="http://twitter.com/scoutdrygoods">scoutdrygoods</a>.</p>
<p>So I figured if a web service has the balls to tell me who my closest friends are... then I'll go for it.  <a href="http://twitter.com/gabek/status/2029553869">I asked them all to dinner</a>.  For some reason they all liked the idea and this Sunday we have the first computer generated guest list to a dinner.  So what happens if a computer tells you who you should hang out with, and then get them all together?</p>

      <title>Making a leap</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/07/making-a-leap</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm going to be a real ass-hat with this post, and I apologize.  I'm not going to tell any details, but instead I'm just going to type and you can be annoyed afterwards.
I've been working on a project.  And at first I thought it was going to go one direction, but then I decided to take it a different direction in my execution of it.</p>
<p>Previous projects I've worked on usually have a life cycle that includes me wanting to build something, I work a lot in all of my spare time on it, putting out a version, and then being drained from my "day job" and unable to continue to work on it anymore.  So it runs in the stable, initial state.  While getting a v1 product out the door is always a good thing, I consistently insult every idea I've ever had because things can go farther.  I'm the only limitation.</p>
<p>There's never really a "perfect time" for a lot of things, so instead I took the thoughts and feelings I have for what I'm currently doing as inspiration to take a different route.  A simple "Would you like change?  Then make choices that create change" kind of thing.  We'll see what happens.</p>
<p>I'll have something cool tomorrow to show everyone, but that has nothing to do with this stuff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mourning the loss of an office</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/07/mourning-the-loss-of-an-office</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday it was announced that the office I used to work at in Chicago, and who many still work at will be closing at the end of October.
I understand that business is business, but these are my friends.  Friends that believed my company when they acquired it a couple years ago and said "this office and everyone in it is going nowhere.  We value the employees here and we're keeping this Chicago office."  Instead they wake up yesterday to find that most are going to be unemployed, and a select few will get offers to move to Omaha in order to keep their position.</p>
<p>It sounds like everyone is taking it well, but I'm upset.</p>
<p>It weighs heavy on me because I left them 8 months ago on my own Omaha journey.  I feel like I should be there with them right now.  That if the ship I helped build was going down, I should be going down with it.</p>
<p>But I guess that's why I left in the first place.  I saw how things were going, and I didn't want to be a part of where it was to end up.  Nobody knew it would be a complete shutdown, but I doubt anyone is exactly surprised either.</p>
<p>All this so some executive can receive a larger bonus and a pat on the back from the board members.  It makes me sick.</p>
<p>My thoughts are with my friends.  I wish there was something I could do.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My interview about Retweet Thursday</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/07/retweet-thursday-interview</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well who would have thought?  The fine people over at <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com">Silicon Prairie News </a>were interested in talking to me about the weirdest meme to ever hit Twitter (aside from #MufasaMonday I suppose), <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23retweet_thursday">#retweet_thursday.</a>
They told me they weren't sure who was behind it at first, but figured out it was out of Omaha somewhere, so they pinpointed it to me.  I never really made it public that the bot was run by me, but I wasn't really hiding the fact either :)</p>
<p>They came to me asking if I'd be willing to tell my story about why it came about, what the deal with the <a class='aptureNoAutolink' href="http://www.twitter.com/rt_thursday">@RT_Thursday</a> account was, and how it all worked.</p>
<p>So take a stop over and check out the article and video interview:</p>

      <title>Seattle trip recap</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/07/seattle-trip-recap</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a nice trip to Seattle last week.  It was really for work purposes, they were sending me to F5 LTM training, but I knew I'd be able to make it into a fun vacation as well.  I had no plans when going there, but that rarely stops me from having a good time.
<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2477/3764437904_fc44ac5ff2.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="The First Starbucks" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2477/3764437904_fc44ac5ff2.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="155" /></a>Thanks to Twitter, and my blog, you're able to see a step by step recap of my whole trip by accessing my <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd19ff3/1355981318235/?format=original">Twitter archive page for the week</a>.  It's really pretty cool, check it out!</p>
<p>I did the tourist thing, went up into the Space Needle, but that's kind of where that ended.</p>
<p>I hung out with <a href="http://twitter.com/dtorgerson/status/2725897315">@dtorgerson</a> and had some drinks.  We chatted about some of our ideas we're working on, and he's doing <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3476/3764415304_a63f5fe912.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3476/3764415304_a63f5fe912.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="168" /></a>some great stuff.  Really exciting.  He also was kind enough to give me a ride over to the Sunset Tavern as I had planned on seeing Mark Mallman that night there.  Mallman puts on a great show, so I was excited to see him again.</p>
<p>Spent that night at the Sunset and talked to some pretty cool people.  A girl I met, Betty, wanted me to email her the photos I took.<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/3764439956_2c47e6c0fc.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/3764439956_2c47e6c0fc.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="171" /></a> Plus it's always fun to try the local brews of the area :)</p>
<p>Then I talked to @<a href="http://www.twitter.com/zria">zria </a>and she told me about the Capitol Hill Block Party, a music festival going on.  So Friday night I went there and met up with her.  The block party was pretty sweet.  Lots of great music and I got to mingle with my type of people.  The local music crowd.  Afterward she gave me a tour of the Capitol Hill area and then brought me to Shorty's.  A bar that has a room full of awesome pinball machines.  It was a really great time.</p>
<p>The next day she brought me to Pike Place Market and I saw some dudes throw fish around.  We ate over a place overlooking the market, and got some yummy coffee.  We hung out in a cool local record store in the Queen Anne hood and later got pizza there.</p>
<p>There was a lot of neat stuff that I saw when there.  The first Starbucks, so much good coffee, little stores and restaraunts, you get the idea.  Typical local stuff in a big city.  But I was lucky to time the trip around the block party and be able to see a lot of music when I was there.  Built to Spill and Deerhunter were performing as well as local bands I never would have heard of otherwise.  Very cool.</p>
<p>As I was there for work purposes,  I had class Tues-Fri, 8-5.  It was a really go<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2430/3763632299_c035bd75c4.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2430/3763632299_c035bd75c4.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="151" /></a>od class, but I did fly through it.  I came off as the "know it all" in the class and people gave me dirty looks.  Oh well.  It gave me a chance to work with a couple instructors and talk about things that I do and would like to do with their products and really get an insight into the company.  Very worthwhile, F5 does very well with their training.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gabekangas/sets/72157621868554600/">I put a photo set up on Flickr</a> of all the photos I took on the trip, so check it out if you're at all interested.  Some neat stuff.</p>

      <title>The military creeps me out</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/07/the-military-creeps-me-out</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So being this is my blog, and I'm really bad at hiding things, once in a while I'll probably write about something pretty unpopular.  This will be one of those posts.  I'm taking the opportunity this day of independence to write about our military.
Now if you're one of those "rah-rah" folks who reply with things like "you should be thanking them for fighting for you" then please do us both a favor and stop reading right now.  I'm serious.</p>
<p>I've been given a bad rap lately because I'm not comfortable being around people that are in the military.  They creep me out.  And I'm generally creeped out even before I know what they do for a...job.</p>
<p>Example from a month or so ago: I was at a bar.  There were all these kinda douche-bagish, clean cut guys.  All playing the "matcho" game.  "Yeah bro", "I'm totally fucking her", etc etc.  I left thinking "Holy crap, that's the biggest collection of asshole douchebags I've had to be around for a while."  Someone replied "Those weren't douchebags, they were military."</p>
<p>Being in Omaha there's some murder-plane air base near here.  I honestly had no idea before I moved here.  In fact knowing about it I probably would have thought twice about coming.  It's because I have a problem with the attitudes of people that go through that "system".  The military takes the guys who wanted to kick my ass in high school and breed them into brain-washed machines.  They come out all with the exact same haircut.  All wearing the same clothes.  All speaking the same way.  And all thinking the same way.  They are cookie cutter people who live in cookie cutter houses.  The only thing not cookie cutter is when they drop them out of planes to shoot people in wars we shouldn't be involved in.</p>
<p>And if you're thinking "you should be thankful that they go jump out of those planes so you don't have to" then what are you doing reading this far?  I told you to stop.  That's a conversation about why they're jumping out of the planes in the first place.  They shouldn't be.  But that's not going to be discussed here.</p>
<p>I've also been told "It's just the career path that was chosen, like any other job."  I have an issue with that as well.  Like for me, I always wanted to be in technology.  That's a career path.  So is "killing" also a career path?  Do people really grow up saying "I want to kill when I'm older?"  Is that a lifelong career path goal?  And I do understand there are plenty of things that aren't the act of killing in the military.  There's tons of technology there as well.  But I just don't know what would bring someone to join the military instead of getting another job.  Wouldn't you need to believe in what they're doing in order to take part in it?  It's not just a job.  It's a lifestyle.  A lifestyle where at the center is the domination and control over the world's people and resources.  That's far different than when I decided what company I wanted to work for.  (Maybe not, my company can be pretty evil too.)  I just know if I don't show up to work they can't throw me in jail for it.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong.  I'm stereotyping.  This may even be seen as the biggest example of stereotyping you've ever read on the internet.  But there's truth in it.  There are also exceptions.  But keep in mind an exception to this stereotype is a failure on the government's part.  The military imprint didn't stick.</p>
<p>So I think i've said my piece.  Any time I meet someone and I'm introduced that they're in the military I'm probably going to step back.  I'm probably going to think "wow, so that's the kind of person they are.  That's what they chose to do with their life?"  I'll know a subset of their views and beliefs right away, and I'll probably try to get out of that conversation.  And that's ok.  There are probably people they'd enjoy talking to more who jive with their lifestyle more anyway.</p>
<p>Happy Independance Day.</p>
<p>(btw I'm keeping comments off on this one for your sake.  You'll probably say something pretty mean.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A new social experiment</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/08/a-new-experiment-meeting-people</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you remember back I recently had <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/06/closest-friends-of-gabe-tweetdinner">#TweetDinner</a>.  Where people a web site decided who  my "closest friends" were all got together for dinner and hung out.  It was a good time, I consider it a success.  It doesn't hurt that they were cool people.
So I think it's time for a new social experiment.</p>
<p>Currently I follow 340 people on Twitter.  Some of them are automated entertainment sources, many of them are out of the area.  So that leaves a good chunk of them as local Omahans.</p>
<p>I'm going to select people, at random, and ask them to hang out.  A drink, dinner, lunch, something.  My guess is many of them will decline, since this is admittedly pretty creepy.  But maybe a few will go along with this crazy idea, and maybe even have a good time.</p>
<p>So some stipulations: If it's already a close friend of mine I'll select someone else.  If it's someone that's not local I'll select someone else.  If they decline I'll select someone else.  If it's not someone who follows me I'll select someone else too.  If they don't know who I am, I doubt they'll want to hang out.</p>
<p>After each outing, I'll vaguely blog about the experience here and post a picture or something.</p>
<p>I'll probably start next week, as I don't have a system in place to select a completely random Twitter user that I follow yet.  Stay tuned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Admiral Ackbar joins Twitter</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/08/admiral-ackbar-joins-twitter</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Per recommendation of @EternalCow I built a bot that puts a much needed appearance of Admiral Ackbar (@AdmiralAckbar_) on Twitter.  He's warning (as he should be) to all who will listen that "It's a trap!"
This is funny, but the most entertaining part is the fact that people are replying back.</p>
<p>See below for a real time update of responses to "It's a trap!"</p>

      <title>Interactions with people and communities, while not having an important common bond.</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/08/lack-of-important-common-bond</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's no secret how much I respect my all of my peers in Omaha.  Some of the most talented, most creative, friendliest, amazing people ever.
But as I learn more about organizations and people here I do see a thread that is often a strong bond between many of them.  And that is the Christian belief community here.</p>
<p>There are some really great organizations, from <a href="http://www.corecommunity.org/">Core Community</a> to <a href="http://incommoncd.org/">inCommon</a>.  Smart people in like minded organizations who in a very modern and effective way get together as groups  to learn and assist others.</p>
<p>As great as all of this is, I find myself second guessing myself.  I'm an atheist.  Often times a slightly outspoken one.  As the word itself means that I have no belief, I fear that people look at me different when they find me identifying as such.  Does my lack of belief in a higher power make people look down on me?</p>
<p>As I meet new people and I find they have strong beliefs I always hope that they don't think badly of me.  The thought of losing new friends, relationships, business connections, or simply acquaintances due to this one item does worry me.</p>
<p>The word "atheist" is often a very strong one to people.  I've had people think I'm a bad person, or I have no values, or heck...  even think I worship the devil.  All it means is I do nothing.</p>
<p>It's like not liking tomatoes.  Some people really love tomatoes and blog about it, grow them, and share them with others.  Those who don't like tomatoes don't think about it and it's not a part of their lives in any way.  Once in a while they're offered a tomato and they just kindly decline.  I see it absolutely no different, but I fear that others may.</p>
<p>What do you think?  Am I over reacting thinking about it at all, or am I justified?</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Come to think of it, I experienced similar things. Many of the younger people I met in Omaha were fairly religious. For me at least that has been different in other cities. I guess the people I've met in other places who are interested in art and culture were not religious at all.
As far as feeling awkward, I'd honestly try to avoid the topic. If it does come up, do speak up if you don't agree. Don't let people think you have the same belief system.  That silence may lead people to think you agree, which would be a shame since they aren't getting to know the real you.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I think it's natural to be sensitive to it, but I've found that members of  the progressive Christian communities in Omaha I've encountered (like the ones you mentioned above) are pretty open and accepting people.
I'm happy to say that they take many of the fundamental Christian teachings to heart and live them more than, um, fundamentalists.  Love thy neighbor is a sentiment strong in Omaha.</p>
<p>I think we've discussed this before, but there are definitely times when I'm the only brown dude in a restaurant or bar (sometimes with a bushy beard) in Omaha where I feel uncertain... watched?  judged?</p>
<p>But eventually it all comes back to the interactions I have with real people, and the people out here are a great people.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>As a fellow Atheist I obviously don't look down on you. In fact I have a lot of respect for you and none of that has anything to do with you being theist or atheist.
You are right that being Atheist should be no different than not liking tomatoes or not collecting stamps. You have accepted your disbelief and it should be a non-issue. For me my Atheism is a huge part of who I am, not because it defines me, but because I am passionate about fighting the intolerance and misconceptions prevalent in our society towards Atheists. If our society was completely tolerant of Atheists I would not feel the need to carry the label. It would be an afterthought. It defines something I am not, which is as trivial as the millions of other things I am not.</p>
<p>The good news is that we live in a fairly tolerant society. There is still a lot of work to be done, but my views have only been a roadblock with a small subset of "believers." I get curious questions from many, but I also generally get respect. There are occasional problems but they are not the rule, they are the exception.</p>
<p>The bad news is that I still must be careful about when I bring up my views and who I bring them up to. It is far harder for me to express my lack of faith than it is for a Christian to express their faith. Its still difficult, if not improbable, for Atheists to hold any type of public office. There are still a huge number of people who don't believe we can be good people and live moral lives. Some people are even offended by the mere public acknowledgment that Atheists exist and assemble. I actually just finished working on a blog post of my own on that very subject. My shameless plug will be pasted below.</p>
<p>In conclusion you might find a few hardships here and there but you can overcome them. I honestly feel we (Atheists) will be more successful in gaining public trust as time goes on, so in the future you and I will have it even easier. It only gets better from here on out!</p>

      <title>The social experiment: #1 Peter Cales</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/08/the-social-experiment-1-peter-cales</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been laughed at.  My sanity has been questioned.  I've even been told that <a target="_blank" href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd19ff6/1355981318307/?format=original">the idea was all just a part of Skynet's plan for world domination</a>.  But I can now proudly say that <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/08/a-new-experiment-meeting-people">"the experiment" (or The Creepy Twitter Experiment)</a> can be executed successfully <a href="http://twitter.com/pgcales/status/3548840299">without death or even serious injury</a>.  As a refresher: I wrote a script to pick a person completely randomly from people I follow on Twitter.  I wanted to meet those who we mutually follow, but never met.  After the first person not replying to my crazy request I got Peter.
<a href="http://twitter.com/pgcales/status/3536816213">Tuesday night, 6:30pm</a>, I met <a href="http://twitter.com/pgcales">Peter Cales</a>, a complete stranger in every sense, at Darios in Dundee, Omaha.</p>
<p>[gallery link="file"]</p>
<p>I was wondering if it was a sign.  Outside of Darios there was some kind of setup for shooting video of some sort.  Commercial, or movie, or who knows.  But I took a quick photo and passed through it into the restaurant.</p>
<p>I sat down at the bar and saw a <a href="http://twitter.com/pgcales/status/3545094685">Tweet from him that he was on his way</a>.  He soon walked through the door.  From the distance not looking much different than the <a href="http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/pgcales?hreflang=en">80x80 pixel avatar </a>that I previously only knew him by on Twitter.  He sat down next to me at the bar and it was on.</p>
<p>I love the fact that he was #1 of this crazy thing.  He's a self admitted non-technical person who has a passion for making custom furniture.  But we soon found what we didn't have in common at the surface people like him and I really do have have here at the core in Omaha.  Him and I both find ourselves right at home among the Omaha (overused term of) Creative Class.  We quickly came to talking about Jeff and Dusty, <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/">SPN</a>, <a href="http://www.bigomaha.com">Big Omaha</a>.  I told him the story about just moving here and receiving a tweet from Jeff welcoming me and hoping him and I could chat soon.  He told me about <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2009/07/five-in-five-with-peter-cales-handmade/">his 5 in 5 he did for</a> <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/">Silicon Prairie News</a> that I had previously seen, but never put it together that it was him.  I told him about <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2009/07/retweet-this-gabek-behind-rt_thursday/">my interview with Danny for Retweet Thursday</a>.  And then trying to explain retweet thursday in a way that doesn't make it sound stupid.  But it's totally stupid, so that's impossible.</p>
<p>We talked of the beer selection.  Quite large for an Omaha bar.  I was impressed.  I'll be going back.  Win.  I found a new place to frequent and tried a new beer.</p>
<p>His friend Rachel came up to us and he introduced me to her.  She courteously asked "so how do you two know each other?"  He looked at me as if to say "that's absolutely the wrong question to be asking".  We tried to explain how I selected him randomly among everyone who I follow on Twitter.  But really, there's no way to discuss that without sounding like complete moron either.  Leaving it at the fact it was our first time hanging out, and we met on the internet is about all you can expect.  I asked Rachel to take the photo of us, and she was on her way.</p>
<p>I learned how he does his work at the Bemis center, downtown.  The bartender, who he knew previously, was interested in stopping down to check out his stuff.  That would be fun, actually.  In my group of friends it's cool to know someone who really makes something.  Sure, code, and words, and all of that stuff... it's real, and it has value.  But something tangible and usable is certainly a world that I forget even exists sometimes.  Who designed the couch I'm sitting on now?  Who designed the keyboard I'm typing on?  Well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive">Johnny Ive</a> did... but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Plenty of other things came up in conversation.  He asked of my job and even though I don't really like talking about what I do and who I work for generally I'm glad I did.  I explained all the process and procedures that goes on in a day in my position.  He gave a gratifying "I'm glad I don't do that" type response.  It's good to know I'm not crazy :)</p>
<p>As I finished my Hoegaarden<em></em> we parted ways.  He said we should do it again sometime.  How cool is that, right?</p>
<p>Now that it's all said and done you're probably thinking "Huh, cool", right?  How many people do you know that make fancy custom furniture?</p>
<p>We haven't picked a time or place, but <a href="http://twitter.com/marenhogan">Maren Hogan</a> is up next.</p>
<p>Oh, and being that it's <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd19ff9/1355981318348/?format=original">Retweet Thursday</a>... you know what to do.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Friday morning started like any other Friday morning.  By Friday afternoon I found out that Andy Peters and I were headed to Chicago that night to see one of the last performances of our favorite band, Nine Inch Nails.</p>
<p>A while back Skid Vis surprised Andy and I by telling us he hooked us up with tickets to the completely sold out Nine Inch Nails show in Chicago.  However it was a "paperless ticketing" show.  Meaning you couldn't just pay for something and then get a physical ticket for admittance in the show.  The person who enters the door of the venue has to be the person who purchased the tickets.  Andy and I didn't purchase any (we tried, though).  So we just kind of assumed there was no way that we could go in.  But Friday just after lunch I received a call from the ticket broker company with details.  We are to meet the person in Chicago who purchased the tickets and go into the show with him.  We were actually going.</p>
<p>Some quick planning and 5:00 hit.  I got home, threw some things into a bag and off we went.</p>
<p>We got in around 3am, but it allowed us to be there all day Saturday.  We got some Giordanos pizza and I gave Andy a quick tour of downtown.  He'd never been to Chicago before, so I wish we would have had more time to hang around.  But there were more important items at hand.  We were going to see Nine Inch Nails for possibly the last time ever.  And we were really lucky to do so.</p>
<p>It was an adventure to actually meet up with the guy, "Steve", who purchased the tickets and then resold them through the broker.  Andy was on the phone talking to this guy and we were looking out for a guy on a phone looking for us.  When we finally tracked down who we believed to be our ticket guy we asked "Are you Steve" and he says "Yes", and we say "Hey, it's us!".  He says "Sorry, I'm on the phone right now."  Turns out it was the wrong "Steve".  The real one finally showed, and we got in.</p>
<p>The show was amazing to say the least.  It was the smallest venue anyone there had probably seen the band in.  It was almost a thank you show to the biggest fans.</p>

<p>We hung out near the sound/light booth and Andy filmed the whole thing using @boutcher's HD camcorder.  I did some qik.com streaming.  There's one below of when we were waiting for Mew to go on.</p>

<p>Speaking of Mew, they put on an awesome show.</p>
<p>Not much really more to say other than it was the best NIN show I've seen.  Not flashy as far as a stage show, but amazing in content.  Trent has been good to us.</p>

      <title>Ten year class reunion</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/09/ten-year-class-reunion</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, ten years since I graduated high school.  Many probably will say "it seems like only yesterday" but to me it seems much, much longer.  In fact, to be honest, I hardly remember those four years at all.  Sure some special moments stand out that included performances or things with friends, but on the whole... really, nothing.
I wasn't planning on going to the reunion.  It wasn't until my friend Becky from high school asked me to go did I cave and signed up and booked a flight.  I figured the people I wanted to talk to I already have on Facebook, and the rest I don't remember anyway.</p>
<p>I kind of feel bad.  I hear my friends on Facebook mention names and I have zero recollection to who they may be.  I suppose I could dig through a year book or something before I head back to Illinois and try to recount people I may run into, but I don't care that much.  I have a group of about five people I'm really looking forward to seeing.  The rest I guess never mattered enough for me to remember that they existed.</p>
<p>We're (more or less) going to stick together as a group and travel via Becky's mom's car who only has a tape deck.  I volunteered to put together a sweet mix tape that would jive with our four years we were there.  And here it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Third Eye Blind - Semi Charmed Life</li>
<li>Bush - Swallowed</li>
<li>Oasis - Wonderwall</li>
<li>The Smashing Pumpkins - Tonight, Tonight</li>
<li>Hanson - MMMBop</li>
<li>Goo Goo Dolls - Black Balloon</li>
<li>Merrill Bainbridge - Mouth</li>
<li>Meredith Brooks - Bitch</li>
<li>Sarah McLachlan - Building a Mystery</li>
<li>Jewel - Foolish Games</li>
<li>Natalie Imbruglia - Torn</li>
<li>Cake - I Will Survive</li>
<li>Savage Garden - I Want You</li>
<li>Spice Girls - Say You'll Be There</li>
<li>Fool's Garden - Lemon Tree</li>
<li>Beck - Where It's At</li>
<li>Beastie Boy s- Intergalactic</li>
<li>Bloodhound Gang - The Bad Touch</li>
<li>Santana and Rob Thomas - Smooth</li>
<li>No Doubt - Sunday Morning</li>
<li>Chumbawamba - Tubthumping</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignright" src="http://www.myschoolreunited.com/Grant/Images/Bulldogs-1351.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="109" /></p>
<p>So here's to Grant Community High School class of 1999.  Go Bulldogs.  Here's where I'll be going, and for your entertainment some photos.</p>

      <title>The freedom of choice.  The fear of making the wrong ones.</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/09/the-freedom-of-choice-but-the-fear-of-making-the-wrong-ones</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">To anyone from work who may come upon this post: hi.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you would have asked me what I wanted to do for a living even just a few years ago I would have described the job I have now.  Heck, even as a kid I envisioned (after wanting to be an astronaut) sitting in a big building somewhere with lots of people in front of a computer cranking out tasks.  That's what I wanted to do with my life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I hate being wrong.  But man was I wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Particularly since I've moved to Omaha I've seen a wave of change come over me.  I see people enjoying what they do.  To be honest, I didn't think it was possible. <a href="http://www.lura.net/03/matrix/images/oracle.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://www.lura.net/03/matrix/images/oracle.jpg" alt="" width="134" height="89" /></a> I just assumed everyone hated what they did and it's a part of life.  But I think that's a genuine difference between Chicago and Omaha.  In Chicago everyone packs up their stuff, jumps on a train or bus, arrives at an office, performs a task and comes home.  In Omaha people wake up and say "What do I want to do with my life today?"  There is a feeling of choice that Chicago never had for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In all honesty, I bitch about my job a lot.  And people probably get sick of it.  I think it's a sense of frustration on my part that 1) I'm good at my job, 2) I can't complain about my compensation at my job, c) At last I have a job.  All checkmarks in the "Pro" column that many people, including my past self, would have loved.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But then the "Cons" column starts piling up.  The syntax friends ask me to do things is in the form of "hey, do you have to work x night?  Can you come out?"  It's an unfortunate given that it's more likely I can't go out with them than I can.  Management doesn't come up to me and say "hey, some things came up where we'll need you to work the next four Friday nights, but go ahead and come in late Monday."  Instead I just look at my queue and see things assigned to me:</p>
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter">
<dl id="attachment_1290" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 380px;">
<blockquote><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a014/1355981318511/?format=original"><img title="You're not busy, right?" height="169" alt="nolife" width="370" class="size-full wp-image-1290" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a014/1355981318511/?format=original" /></a></dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">You're not busy, right?</dd>
</blockquote>
</dl>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">What if I had plans?  Actually, I do have plans.  I have a life, I have friends.  I plan on doing things.  I find it slightly insulting that it's assumed otherwise, or they don't care.  And if I work until 3am, and come staggering work with next to no sleep a few minutes late I don't get "thanks for your hard work last night", I get emails like this:</p>
<blockquote><address><em>"Our work day starts at 8 am.  If you are going to be more  than 5 minutes late, you are to contact your supervisor or prearrange any  schedule changes[...] Everyone on  this email has a high school diploma so I can safely assume you have all reached  the recognized age of adulthood.  Let’s act like it.   If it continues to be a  problem, I will have to micromanage the situation."</em></address>
</blockquote>
<p>Ouch.  To be honest, I don't think management even realizes people are up at all hours of the night working for them.  They're nameless faces so far up the corporate ladder looking for the smallest things that are wrong instead of apologizing for ruining nights and weekends for the people who work so hard to keep this company moving.</p>
<p>But this post isn't to complain.  This post is to say that I have a choice.  I can chose to be a worker bee, ashamed of who I work  for and the work I do, or chose to do something else.</p>
<p>Until now my mantra was "the evil I know is better than the evil I don't know."  There is no promise that making a rash decision to leave a position for another would leave me in a better place.  Any move you make can be for the worse, but you don't know that until it's too late.  So I figured as long as I can live my life and deal it would certainly be better than than going to an unknown place that I may hate just as much or more.</p>
<p>So I'm going to take a plunge and see what's out there.  Talk to some people.  See where I may fit and be happy.  I have support of friends (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/bspersonal?v=feed&amp;story_fbid=133943332829">some who I think are determined to get me a new role elsewhere with my involvement or not</a>).  Regardless, it's better than bitching on Twitter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>If you are not appreciated, it's time to move on.  I was gone back in november had I not gotten sick.  Why?  Not b/c of the work, but never feeling appreciated.  The more I got done, the more they loaded up on me.
Just remember what price you are willing to pay in your career. When it becomes more than that, move on.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Its about time! I'll be honest, I don't always like where I work but damn... its nothing like what you have to deal with. And I actually plan on jumping ship eventually when I find something that feels right and I've got my resume built up just a bit better. I would leave tomorrow if the right opportunity presented itself but I will start actively looking relatively soon. I think people like you and I would do great in a start-up environment if either of us could find a good one to join. We're young and don't have a lot to loose... don't be afraid to take the plunge. You won't regret it.
Oh, and if you find a place that needs another coder... BRING ME WITH YOU! Please!?</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Way to go Gabe...I know if I would have gotten that email in my inbox...I probably would have flipped out and just left.  I have been in your spot before, and you are right, it isn't about money, and it isn't about the work load, cause let's be honest, the people that love their jobs, the kind of person you want to become, are the ones that work harder than most everyone else.  It is about not having to put up with crap like that email.  ps....I don't mind the bitching on twitter, kinda nice to remember why I left that environment! :)  Good luck with the search!  You will find something great...</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>My thoughts on the Mophie Juicepack</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/10/my-thoughts-on-the-mophie-juicepack</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mophie.com/v/vspfiles/photos/1059_JPA-IP3G-BLK-2.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://www.mophie.com/v/vspfiles/photos/1059_JPA-IP3G-BLK-2.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="245" /></a>A few weeks ago I purchased the <a href="http://www.mophie.com/product-p/1059_jpa-ip3g-blk.htm">Mophie Juicepack Air</a> in preperation for my trip to Chicago for my class reunion.  When I announced on Twitter I was picking one up I had a few requests for my thoughts on it after some use.
Admittedly, the new iPhone 3GS has substantially better battery live than the 3G.  Very noticeable.  However, there are times and situations where that's still not good enough.  I thought forward about what my situation would probably be.  I'd be flying on a plane listening to music/watching videos (no way to charge), then getting off the plane and going downtown (no way to charge), then hanging out at the CenterPost office (not charging), then heading out to wherever I was going to end up for the remainder of the day (maybe not charging).  And not knowing where I'd be staying one night to the next I knew when I had an opportunity to charge I had to make it worth my while.</p>
<p>So the Mophie Juice Pack allows you to double your battery life by building a battery into a hard case for your iPhone.  You can turn it on and off at will, and I think that's really key.  When you turn it on it starts to charge your internal iPhone battery.</p>
<p>Knowing gadgets and charging like I do there are times and places to be charging a device.  Inside your warm, confined pocket is not one of those times.  Not only does the device head up when charging (like almost all electronics do), but it can't be good for that to happen while against your body with no way for it to exchange heat to the outside world.  So I made sure only to turn on the Juicepack when it was on a table, or sitting next to me, or I was watching a video or something.  I never just turned it on and then shoved it in my pocket.  I don't recommend you do either.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.mophie.com/v/vspfiles/photos/8003_USB-MICRO-32-BLK-3T.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="130" /></p>
<p>The only drawback I see is the cable that's used to charge the Juicepack (and therefore your iPhone as well).  It allows you to still sync your iPhone to your computer while the Juicepack is on, so that's cool.  It charges both the external and internal battery at the same time.  That's cool.  But it's some lame proprietary cable.  That's not cool.  It looks exactly like a micro usb, but it's just a little different.  So if you lose it you have to go buy a new one from mophie for $10.</p>
<p>Was it worth the $80 or whatever?  Yeah, it really was.  Now I keep it with me in my bag, fully charged and I can take it out any time an emergency arises.  I haven't had to, but you never know.  It'll happen.</p>
<p>It's a great device, and it's built well.  Adds very little extra size to your iPhone.  So if you're willing to spend the money on it, and you know you could use it, I wouldn't think twice about recommending it to you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Reflecting on my ten year High School reunion</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/10/reflecting-on-my-ten-year-high-school-reunion</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn't originally want to go.  But to everyone who told me I should: Thank you.
<a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/09/ten-year-class-reunion">Everyone knows I didn't know what to expect</a>.  But now that the Grant Community High School class of 1999 reunion is over I can't help but look at those four years far different than I did before.  I'll be honest and tell you that I really did discount that time.  It wasn't awful, but I was glad it was behind me.  But now after reuniting with my friends for the first time in ten years I realize things were quite different than I remember them.</p>
<p>I forgot how amazing my friends were in high school.  Smart, passionate, creative, extremely fun people.  Obviously I know I had a good time with them, but I forgot the details.  I guess time can do that.  I forgot all of that "silly fun" we used to have.  The singing in the car, the dancing like an idiot.  All the inside jokes.  And it came back right away.  Immediately.  We all picked up where we left off.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4hI1YP_PIig&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4hI1YP_PIig&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Becky is still the beautiful, intelligent, exciting girl that she always was.  Al, though certainly out of his shell in so many ways, is still the logical guy I always remembered.  Michelle... is still Michelle.  Loud, passionate, and proud of it.  Christy is still the bubbly, cheery girl that you never find without a smile on her face.</p>
<p>Starting from the moment I saw Becky Friday I felt like I was transported into a different world.  I was sent back in time and surrounded by the people who filled my life from 1995 - 1999.  We goofed around, we ate good food, we saw old teachers, we went to the football game, we partied hard and I didn't want to leave.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2653/3970967706_be3599dd24.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2653/3970967706_be3599dd24.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="274" /></a>We immersed ourselves in the soundtrack of the 90s.  The boy bands, the pop rock, the Lilith Fair superstars.</p>
<p>The only thing different is that we could legally drink with each other now.  Something none of us partook in during the high school years.   Our group was too busy with rehearsals and performances to go party like many may have in their four years.  We discussed how others would have parties and sneak in beer or wine coolers, where that was always the last thing on our minds.  We had no interest in it.<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3460/3970190519_b3c012a697.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3460/3970190519_b3c012a697.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>Our favorite teacher showed up to the reunion.  Something he's never done before.  He felt we were a special group and he wanted to see us all again.  To celebrate we took part in a 10 person shot.  Who would have thought ten years later I'd be buying my teacher a drink.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wish I could have spent more time with Amanda Glassford <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2563/3970191749_3f6e5a8ed5.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2563/3970191749_3f6e5a8ed5.jpg" alt="" width="26" height="18" /></a>, who never graduated from Grant due to a family move, but always felt that it was her home.  And Jill <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2506/3970961138_1c0cd626e4.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2506/3970961138_1c0cd626e4.jpg" alt="" width="22" height="16" /></a>who I lived near for years after moving to Illinois.  I hadn't talked to her even online in the ten years since graduation.  And Amanda Perryman who just recently joined Facebook and I was able to say hi to again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So all in all was it a good experience?  No, it was an amazing experience.  It makes me wish the past ten years would have had these people in my life more than they were.  Even though we've all scattered across the country I've never made an attempt once to see any of them, ever.  And to make it worse, maybe due to having internet access to them at any time I wanted: I didn't feel the need to.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now I do.  I miss them, and that's a good feeling.</p>

      <title>Choices, decisions and fear: Part 2.</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/11/choices-decisions-and-fear-part-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm a fan of transparency.  I like to know what people are up to, and I think there are people that like to know what I'm up to as well.  This includes the background and emotions behind major life decisions.  So here's my story.
If you're reading this you already know it's been a rough couple months as far as my career path goes.  I knew I needed to move elsewhere, but I didn't know in what capacity.</p>
<p>I didn't know if I was unhappy with the company, unhappy with my role, unhappy with my direction, unhappy with those I worked with... I just didn't know.  What I did know was that I was unhappy and I saw no chance of that changing without a major overhaul in my "professional" life.</p>
<p>So I took a step back and looked at the world around me, specifically those who inhabit it.</p>
<p>I looked at what others do, not particularly career wise.  But what their life consists of.  I looked at the tweets people made and took note when I said "I wish my life could have what they're doing right now."</p>
<p>This consisted of things like "I wish I could go to South By Southwest next year" or "I wish when AIM has breakfasts I could attend" or "I want more time to spend on projects that I care about, personally and professionally."</p>
<p>Having a list of what's important to me right now and in the short term made me realize that in order to pull off a big change, it requires big changes.  None of what I want out of life can happen as long as I'm working for a large corporation where I'm nothing more than a number.  Where taking a day off in order to take part in something much larger than a 8-5 is frowned upon.</p>
<p>So a lot of thought and discussion went into what I did today.  I put in my notice to leave West Corporation.</p>
<p>In the words of Gary Vaynerchuk "Don't come up and say 'I quit my job!!!' and expect me to be happy for you.  Don't you have bills or anything?"  And yeah, I kind of have to not be homeless and keep my car and stuff.  So it turns out working is a requirement.  Details.</p>
<p>In comes multiple discussions with Rahul Gupta's Dispatch This.  He came to me personally saying he wanted to bring me on as a developer for his product.  We met a few times and now I'm hired to work there in a part-time capacity.</p>
<p>It's a huge win to know I have guaranteed income coming in, if only part-time.  But I do have to make up for the rest.  Luckily it turns out there's some really neat people in Omaha who need stuff done and would like me to work on them on it.</p>
<p>This includes joining up with the Contemporary Analysis team to grow their budding IT branch to include web hosting, development, and further expanding their options to clients as a one stop shop for products provided by CA.</p>
<p>All of this is really exciting for me.  It gives me the opportunity to work on a handful of products both on the Dispatch This side, where they have a steady client base, and on the "i have this great idea, work with me on it" type stuff elsewhere in the community.</p>
<p>But to be honest I'm scared shitless.</p>
<p>Do I know what the steps are to make this bohemian technology lifestyle work?  Absolutely not.  Is it possible that I fail?  Absolutely.  Is it worth the risk?  To me, yes.  Others (parents) think i'm an idiot to give up everything I've worked so hard for in cube-land.  But I don't see it as that at all.  I'm happy to give up my cube, my required office hours, my high stress/low productivity environment.  Giving up my lack of pride in return for some real excitement with what I do with my time is a pretty ok tradeoff for me.</p>
<p>In all seriousness I'm giving up a good salary, benefits, and a "you know what you're doing today, how much money you'll get every couple weeks, and the fact you don't have to worry about that."</p>
<p>But I'm in a place where I think the risk is worth it.  I may fall on my face in complete failure.  But a failure story is still a story.  I'm certainly not making any stories where I'm at now.</p>
<p>Thanks for the support everyone.  I never would have done anything like this without all the ass kicking from people like Rahul Gupta, Brian Smith, Dusty Davidson, Steph Monge, Tim Kephart and so many others.</p>
<p>I'm cautiously optimistic that things will work out.  But please wish me the best.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Congrats Gabe-
I know you will do great! I quit my full time job 1 year ago to run DownsDesign full time and was in the exact same position. Funny thing about Omaha is it has a way of helping its peeps out.</p>
<p>There are such great people here; work hard, continue to be awesome and I know you will find the same!</p>
<p>Way to go homie!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

Even if the very unlikely situation were to happen where you fall flat on your face, there are too many people here that care about you and would pick you up.

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Awesome awesome news Gabe. I talk a lot about how Omaha should do more to "embrace a culture of risk-taking", and the overwhelmingly positive response to your announcement makes me very excited to think that maybe the tides are turning. I have no doubt that you will be successful, as you have a community of folks that care about you. Best of luck, and you know that if you need anything from the BrightMix crew, we support you!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

Every event is a new perspective &amp; I know your new path will open amazing doors for you that you didn't even know existed.

Gary V was a huge inspiration to me as well and I too am moving forward with my dreams...albeit slowly.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This isn't the first time I've made a post like this.  In fact I <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2006/12/end-of-year-wrapup-2006">used to</a> <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a01d/1355981318691/?format=original">make a yearly recap</a> of all the tools, software, hardware, etc that made me productive that year.  For whatever reason I didn't this past year.  Not sure why.  Guess I was busy hanging out with you or something.
Inspired by <a href="http://www.ninthdivision.com/blog/2009/10/barcamp-omaha-2009-was-a-success/">Andy Peter's Barcamp Omaha talk </a>I thought I'd share some  non-obvious things I use to do things on a daily basis.  I like to share.  Do you?  Have a cookie.</p>
<h1>Apps for Mac OS X</h1>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="538" caption="My Dock at some random point in time"]<a href="http://dropbox.real-ity.com/GEKdock.jpg"><img title="My Dock" src="http://dropbox.real-ity.com/GEKdock.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="34" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<h2><a href="http://xtralean.com/IWOverview.html">ImageWell</a></h2>
<p>I use ImageWell almost daily.  It's a simple graphic capture and upload tool.  You configure a couple FTP/webdav/drive locations and you can capture selections or the whole of your screen.  Or take an image file and just drop it onto the icon.   Hit "Send" and it uploads it to that location and puts the URL of the file in your clipboard to paste wherever.  In fact that's how I captured my dock that's shown above.  You can do some simple editing such as crop, watermark, some little filters as well.  It's so stupid easy that I couldn't imagine not having it.  I have mine configured for my mobileMe and Flickr accounts.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a></h2>
<p>I just actually recently started using Dropbox.  It's really simple way to have a folder sync'ed with all your other machines, and even your iPhone.  For me this includes documents and code.  I really like developing on my desktop, but when I'm at a coffee shop and want to pick up where I left off with my MacBook Pro the code is sitting right there.  I'm also planning on migrating my iTunes library (the data file, not the actual music) to my Dropbox so every machine has an up to date version.  I'll let you know how that works out.</p>
<h2><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a></h2>
<p>If you code on a mac, and it's not an Xcode project, TextMate is the editor to use.  At least that's what I've found.  I really love it.</p>
<h2><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xchataqua/">X-Chat Aqua</a></h2>
<p>As an avid IRC'er I've tried every IRC client on pretty much every platform.  Windows, OS X, *nix GUI and console, iPhone, Palm OS, BeOS, you name it.  The client I keep coming to is the free X-Chat.  It's simple and highly scriptable.  On my mac it's how I keep in touch with my IRC friends around the world on a daily basis.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a></h2>
<p>If you do work on the internet you need a good FTP client.  Transmit is my favorite.  I pair it with TextMate when editing files live on a server.  Double click, edit in TextMate, save, Transmit sends the updated file back up automatically.  That's how life is supposed to work, folks.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a></h2>
<p>I use this constantly as a cloud-based location for any snips of text that I ever need.  Addresses, phone numbers, code, things grabbed from web sites, anything.  I just drag and drop from Safari right into Evernote on the dock and lo and behold it's right there on my iPhone when I need it.  This is especially great when I'm going somewhere and I need an address.  I just drag it from Google to Evernote, and then open it up on on my iPhone later when I need it in the car.  It's free, but there's a paid pro version as well.  I paid for it because it's just that cool.  I didn't get it at first, but now that I do... I'm glad.</p>
<h2><a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a></h2>
<p>I'm a bit of a poser here.  I have Things, and I sometimes use Things.  I'm currently trying to force myself to put everything in Things and stop relying on short term memory when it comes to prioritization and execution.  I think Things will become more useful coming up here in the short term, and I'll let you know how it goes.  Personally I think the reason why I haven't been able to go 100% Things is the fact I'm forced to a Windows desktop most of the time because of my current job.  Sure, I have my iPhone.  But I find it hard reaching for my iPhone to do things when I'm already at a keyboard.  I have the iPhone and OS X Desktop versions.  They sync, and they're easy to use.</p>
<h1>iPhone Apps</h1>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1406" align="aligncenter" width="200" caption="My iPhone"]<a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a020/1355981318725/?format=original"><img title="My iPhone" height="300" alt="My iPhone" width="200" class="size-medium wp-image-1406" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a023/1355981318737/?format=original" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Check out my list of <a href="http://appsfire.com/selection.php?cid=1256881754-1495711598&amp;title=Everything+non-Jailbreak+that%27s+installed">installed iPhone apps</a>, <a href="http://appsfire.com/selection.php?cid=1256881697-335957361&amp;title=Games+Gabe+has+installed+currently">Games</a>, <a href="http://appsfire.com/selection.php?cid=1256881512-1066602454&amp;title=Apps+Gabe+uses+daily">Used Daily</a>, and <a href="http://appsfire.com/selection.php?cid=1256881948-1687987801&amp;title=Neat+ones+you+might+like">obscure recommendations</a> too.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/">Tweetie</a></h2>
<p>Who would have thought that a Twitter client would be a "tool", but for me it is.  Often times a tool for destroying productivity, but more often than not it allows me to connect with people and get things done in a way a couple years ago I'd never be able to.  I also use the OS X version of Tweetie as my desktop client, but I don't really recommend that over anything else.  Where on the iPhone Tweetie version 2 is the champ.</p>
<h2>Scrobbld</h2>
<p>It'll scrobble (post to Last.FM) a song in real-time from your iPhone.  Makes sense.  You have a device playing music that's on the internet, why shouldn't it be able to submit the song while you listen to it?  Requires jailbreak.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/remote/">Remote</a></h2>
<p>Stupid, but I use it a ton.  Say I was laying in bed and I wanted the song "Semiotic Love" by "Blaqk Audio" to start playing in my livingroom via the AppleTV, my bedroom via Airport Express, or any other mix of devices.  I could do that, and it would look something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a026/1355981318763/?format=original"><img title="iPhoneremote" height="240" alt="iPhoneremote" width="160" class="size-medium wp-image-1449 alignnone" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a029/1355981318774/?format=original" /></a></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.intelliborn.com/products.html">IntelliScreen</a></h2>
<p>Makes your iPhone lock screen a dashboard of unread email, new text messages, your calendar, news and more.  It's a jailbreak app that takes some resources and in the past has been kind of flakey.  It works better on my 3GS than it did on my 3G.  Given its faults, I still really like it.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.intelliborn.com/products.html">elert</a></h2>
<p>Gives a Growl-like popup when new email comes in.  Simple, but I really like it.  If i'm on my iPhone and a new email comes in I can know what the content of that message is without leaving what app I'm in.  This should be built in iPhone functionality, personally.</p>
<h2><a href="http://boxcar.io/">Boxcar</a></h2>
<p>It supports push notifications for Tweets, Facebook updates and anything that can be sent to an email address.  I use it for all three.  Next time you hang out with me and notice my phone beeping and buzzing every minute or so... this is the app to blame for that.  When someone sends a tweet to @gabek I get a push notification via Boxcar.  When someone replies to a Facebook status update, I get a notification via Boxcar as well.  And I have a Boxcar email address that I have as a part of my paging notifications for work.</p>
<h1>Web services</h1>
<h2><a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks</a></h2>
<p>Due to Andy Peters' recommendation I use Freshbooks for time tracking, creating estimates, and invoicing for any client work.  Quality product and there's even an iPhone app that ties into it.  With my new venture into Life 2.0 I need some help as far as the "paperwork" goes, it's not my forte.  This product does that for me, and I thank it wholeheartedly.  I mean otherwise... a spreadsheet?  Quickbooks?  Man... I don't even want to think about it.  Don't quote me on this if some day I have to end up using Quickbooks.</p>
<h2><a href="http://brizzly.com/">Brizzly</a></h2>
<p>My web Twitter client of choice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Windows 7 Launch Party</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/11/the-windows-7-launch-party</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I meant to put this together weeks ago, but I guess things got in the way.  But Windows 7 is released only once in a lifetime, so I couldn't just forget about it.
Earlier this month @shinyhat threw a Microsoft sanctioned Windows 7 launch party and he invited me along for the ride.  It had all of the stuff that Microsoft sent him.  Posters, streamers, playing cards, poker chips, a puzzle, and even a Microsoft trivia game.</p>
<p>It was just as Windowstastic as I could ever expect.  From the logo colored front windows to the custom "7" on the wall the guy really went all out.  We even had 7-layer dip.</p>
<p>It was mostly a group of Apple fans there, so we discussed failed Zune installs, Windows blue screens, and other typical Microsoft faire.  Best Windows party ever.</p>
<p>Some day you can tell your kids you knew someone who went to a real Windows 7 launch party.  Note the cameo by @programmerman as well.  Enjoy.</p>

      <title>I've been quiet!  I've been busy!</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/01/ive-been-quiet-ive-been-busy</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven't blogged for quite a while.  And that's not a bad thing.
It's been a couple months now since I left my position at West, and I haven't said a word about it since then.  There's no real reason why except I've been super busy.  Busy with a handful of really awesome things.</p>
<p>I've had the chance to work on some really neat projects lately, and I'm really looking forward to continuing it.  Leaving the corporate world is certainly up on my "best things I've ever done" list, right up there with moving to Omaha, the city that's allowing me to do it.</p>
<p>Though the most exciting thing, hands down, is going forward with a project, lovingly dubbed <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=mysteriousdottie">Mysterious Dottie</a>,  that has been my baby since early last year.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1492" align="alignright" width="252" caption="The team hard at work"]<img title="The team hard at work" height="190" alt="" width="252" class="size-medium wp-image-1492  " src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a02c/1355981318811/?format=original" />[/caption]</p>
<p>Since the early days of its development <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/07/making-a-leap">I've stayed quiet about the idea and the execution</a>.  While developing it alone I put in a lot of time, and still was dark about it to all but a few.</p>
<p>Though now I've teamed up with <a href="http://twitter.com/timothykephart">Timothy Kephart</a> who's offering to supercharge the project.  It's grown in scope, cost, and people involved.  I've dropped the initial development in order to start over with a team of people, in addition to me, who are building this to be an amazing product.</p>
<p>This is nothing short of a kick ass opportunity to see my baby come to life, though at the same time I'm extremely defensive of it.  I'm the first to attempt to stomp out scope creep, "cooks in the kitchen" syndrome, and any kind of bastardization of my product.  Even though it's no longer mine.</p>
<p>I've never worked with a team in development before.  Everything I've ever done has been mine from start to finish.  This is mostly because I've never really had a corporate development job where you're building products as a team under project managers.  I feel myself going back and forth from wondering "am I leading this team?" or am I "just a developer" or " I'm an asshole".  Asshole, of course, being the title of my role who gets upset when my initial vision is going in a direction that I don't see it make sense in going.  (As a joke I say they're going to turn it into a <a href="http://www.mysteriousdottie.com/Mysterious_Dottie_Game/The_Future_of_Mobile_Gaming.html">3D gaming platform</a>).</p>
<p>So I'm learning a lot.  I'm learning to pick my battles and fight for things I'm passionate about.  But I'm also learning I'm possibly a little too touchy when it comes to what I'm passionate about.</p>
<p>I'm lucky that I really respect everyone on this team.  They're all stupid smart in their own specialties and holy crap I'm excited.  It's what I've dreamed of, but at the same time I'm trying my best to adjust.  I really think this is one of the most important things I've ever had a chance to be a part of, and I'm so very proud of it.  I can't wait to show it off to the world.  I just hope everyone involved are still friends with me by the time we're done :)</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone from team <a href="http://mysteriousdottie.com">dottie</a> asks... I never wrote this post.  You didn't see anything.  *<strong>wink</strong>*</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Gabe takes on South by Southwest Interactive 2010</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/03/gabe-takes-on-south-by-southwest-interactive-2010</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I've convinced myself of in this past year is that if there's something I want to do, then I should do it.<a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a02f/1355981318834/?format=original"><img title="sxsw-logo" height="240" alt="" width="218" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1523" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a033/1355981318846/?format=original" /></a>
Sounds simple right?  But not so much.  In this particular example, South by Southwest, it's something I've wanted to attend for years.  But instead of just deciding I was going to go I wallowed in my cube and read/watched what was going on in the week long center of the world.  I know you're saying "well it's your own fault for not doing something you wanted to do", and it's true.  It was one of those things I convinced myself that everyone else does, but not me.  For instance:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2007/03/man-its-sxsw-time-already-how-time-flies-ill-sure-be-busy">2007 I had a depressing post, not even making an attempt to think that I should go.</a> Of course that time in my life was pretty crappy and I wouldn't had been able to go even if I made the decision to.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/03/alright-ill-blog-leave-me-alone-about-it">In 2009 I called it "a big circle jerk, that I want to be a part of".</a></p>
<p>At some point after that I realized life was short and from then on I'm just going to do the things that would make me happy, or at least make the attempt to.</p>
<p>So making the trip to Austin this year is quite symbolic for me.  For many it's that thing people do every year, but for me it's one of the many things I never let myself do before.</p>
<p>So stupid depressing Gabe history lesson aside.  <strong>Fuck yeah - South by Southwest</strong>.</p>
<p>I would be going anyway, because I want to, but it just so happens I actually have reasons to go.  With my world surrounded around Mysterious Dottie I can't not use this opportunity to see what's going on in the world.  Compare, contrast, maybe even have a few chats.</p>
<p>Aside from the "business stuff", I'm pumped to see people.  There's people I've known for years that I've never met in person that I'll finally be able to say hi to.</p>
<p>There are some awesome panels I'm really looking forward to.  <a href="http://my.sxsw.com/user/schedule/gkangas" target="_blank">I put my schedule up if you're at all interested in what panels I may be attending</a>.  Though it's just a list of things I may be interested in without taking scheduling into consideration.  I'm sure the process will be dynamic throughout the festival.</p>
<p>And of course: the parties.  Hopefully it'll be an awesome chance to meet some really neat people from all over the world.  Smart people with ideas, and ambition, and interests similar to mine.</p>
<p>So enough of me blabbing about this.  If you're at all interested in following my journey to Austin, as always<a href="http://twitter.com/gabek" target="_blank"> follow me on Twitter</a>, and check out what locations I'm at via <a href="http://foursquare.com/user/gabek" target="_blank">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://gowalla.com/users/gabek" target="_blank">Gowalla</a>.  Honestly I'll probably be using Gowalla more than Foursquare just for this trip because of the Austin home town service advantage.  Plus they're giving out VIP admission to parties ;)</p>
<p>And lastly: I apologize in advance to all of you following me on services who are going to really get sick of my updates and photos.  Sorry!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I survived South by Southwest Interactive 2010</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/03/sxsw201</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writing a wrap-up post about South by Southwest I would imagine is similar to writing about being teleported to another universe for a short time.  A universe where there are no words that a human can make to explain the things they saw.
So in that vein let me tell you that it was so.... yeah.  Thanks everyone, <strong>have a great weekend.</strong></p>
<p>Alright, I'll give this a shot.  It was everything I thought it could be, and more.  Every story and rumor and thought you may have heard about South by is true.  You turn the corner and there's someone you recognize.  Mostly those of "internet fame".</p>
<p>People say the best part about the conference is the connections you make, and that's absolutely the truth.  While the panels were sometimes fun I got less out of them than I thought I would.</p>
<p>The sessions that I went into knowing things about I left saying "that wasn't anything I didn't already know".  Some panels were mis-titled or had bad descriptions.  The couple "core conversations" were kind of lame because it was up to the group to keep things moving... and sometimes it didn't.</p>
<p>That being said, there were some really great ones.  My favorites:<a href="http://vimeo.com/10252130" target="_blank"> Selling your subculture without selling out</a>, Web framework battle, How Pandora navigated the smartphone seas, Is Canvas the end of Flash, and Getting your company funded.  That last VC-based session being a real eye opener for me.</p>
<p>Keep in mind most of the links in this post are photos, so click away.  I didn't want to embed everything here.</p>
<h2>Highlights:</h2>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="350" caption="Tom Conrad of Pandora"]<a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4441961529_8c4b1385e3.jpg"><img title="Tom Conrad of Pandora" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4441961529_8c4b1385e3.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="263" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Years after launching PandoraFM with support from Pandora I finally met Tom Conrad, CTO of Pandora Media.  This is a guy when given the option between kicking my work off the internet for using the Pandora service in a way they didn't intend, or working with me to build something cool... he chose the later.  Since then I've looked up to him as the type of person I want to end up being in the internet business landscape.  Running something awesome while being awesome.  It was a long time coming for us to meet, and on top of it his talk on the mobile story of Pandora was one of the best.</p>
<p>I met Veronica Belmont at the gdgt party.  Your typical internet celebrity crush.  I think I mumbled a "ahhbauhdagaaa" to her.  I suppose that was better than the alternative of "DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE VERONICA BELMONT?"  She was really nice, and it was cool to just run into her.  At that same gdgt party I saw <a href="http://roj.as/" target="_blank">Peter Rojas</a> and <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2752/4442744488_69fe34818b_o.jpg">chatted with him a bit</a>.  I've listened to him on podcasts over the years and read his material in numerous online tech blogs.  It's awesome being able to talk one on one with someone when you've known them in such a different context for so long.</p>
<p>Kat asked me if I could snap a picture of <a href="http://www.brepettis.com/" target="_blank">Bre Pettis</a> from a distance for her.  I thought I'd see what I could do and see if I could actually talk to him and say hi to him for her and grab a picture of us two.  <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2696/4441929799_7849b36544_o.jpg">Success</a>.  By coincidence I ran into him on the street later that week and chatted for a bit.</p>
<p>The Gawker Timewarp party.  It was a dream world for me.  I got to <a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4023/4442715034_c2950e65cf_o.jpg">meet MC Frontalot</a> and see him perform.  It had Star Wars characters hanging around.  It had geek girls.  It had nerdcore fans.  It had free alcohol. I couldn't make this party up if I tried.  I love MC Frontalot and his show did not disappoint.  Awesome.  Awesome. <a href="http://vimeo.com/10149112">MC Frontalot at the Gawker Timewarp party</a>

<p>The Silicon Prairie party was a great time.  It was cool to see so many people hanging with the kids from Nebraska.  I tried to talk to as many people that I didn't recognize as I could and find out how they found out about the party.  Most were friends of a friend or were told about the party by someone "in the circle".</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="The Silicon Prairie Party"]<a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4442738118_7710c4ba9e_m.jpg"><img title="The Silicon Prairie Party" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4442738118_7710c4ba9e_m.jpg" alt="The Silicon Prairie Party" width="240" height="180" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>I met Gina Trapani!  I made a joke that I actually saw someone using Google Wave while at the conference and she gave me a copy of her Google Wave book.<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4441966595_9d9ef13d55_o.jpg"> I had her autograph it for me</a>.  I've always really enjoyed her technical work she's given the world, not to mention the writing and podcasting she does.  Very cool.</p>
<p>Went to the Gowalla Tiki Room party and had some delicious drinks, got stuck in the rain, <a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4442745182_a1147a90be_o.jpg">and saw Diplo spin</a>.  I like Diplo, so that was cool to have him the soundtrack of one kickin' party.</p>
<p>Met some awesome people in person and digitally!  I got to hang out with Gwen, @ReelVixen, and it was a blast.  We've only more or less known each other through the internet and it was awesome to share the SxSW experience with her.  Hello to new awesome people @stephaniehobson, @fiercecupcake, @playfulpixel, @kristenbyers, @ElaDarling, and special thanks to @TheJenya  for showing me around and hanging out!  She's releasing a book of notes and comic drawings based on her time at South by, I can't wait to see what she's come up with once it goes online.  Check her out at <a href="http://www.mermaidhostel.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mermaidhostel.com/</a></p>
<p>So yeah, I'm not sure what else to say.  There was so much great stuff, and I have to stop somewhere.  <a href="72157623643037074" target="_blank">So check out my photos from the trip, I took a bunch</a>.  I probably left out a lot, but hey... I tried.  Austin, I'll see you next year.</p>

      <title>I was asked what I've been doing.  So here you go!</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/04/i-was-asked-what-ive-been-doing-so-here-you-go</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I struggled on what should be included in this post.  A part of me thinks having a veil over personal feelings about things that I'm doing are a good thing.  But that's the opposite of transparency, and I do want to take as many people on the wild ride with me as possible.
A while back my buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/franktronic">Frank</a> said my next blog post should be about what I'm doing.  It wasn't until then that I realized from the outside (especially outside of Omaha), what I do, what my goals are, and my what daily routine is may seem a little odd, if not completely invisible.</p>
<p>So what do I do?  I balance my time between being the developer of DispatchThis, a software as a service company, and doing "anything else".</p>
<p>And when I say anything, that's really what it means.</p>
<p><a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/11/choices-decisions-and-fear-part-2">I left my "real job" in November</a>, and it seems almost six months later I'm just starting to get into the flow of the world I threw myself into.  Making the contacts, proving myself through local projects, all those kinds of things required to be independent, but not homeless.</p>
<p>I've taken on some neat things since November.  From custom Wordpress stuff, to building Facebook applications.  Some neat apps integrating with 3rd party APIs and generally turning people's ideas into reality.  Honestly, there's very little I can complain about when it comes to the work that I do. I have the city of Omaha and my friends here to thank for all of it.  From pushing me into this direction (albeit I was kicking and screaming the whole way), to the references and endorsements.</p>
<p>I don't spend time in one place for too long.  You can generally find me working from what I dub "the office", my favorite coffee shop, <a href="http://www.caffeinedreams.net/">Caffeine Dreams</a>.  On Tuesdays I work from @rahulgupta's house.  Other days you may find me at <a href="http://www.haloinstitute.org/">The Halo Institute</a> or Graffiti Tracker's office.  Though I do have a "home office" setup, I almost never work from there.  Why would I want to when there's so many other options to be a part of the community and meet cool people while I do cool things?  I love this part of my life.  I considered "getting out of the cube" symbolic, but I feel so much more alive.  I can't recommend enough that people find a way to get out of the corporate office and into the world.  People say the "real world" is having a stuffy job in an office building, but to me the real world is just the opposite.  I love that I have the opportunity to live in this world.</p>

Last July."]<a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a036/1355981318932/?format=original"><img title="Day 1 of Mysterious Dottie.  Last July." height="75" style="margin: 5px; border: 0px initial initial;" alt="" align="left" width="100" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a036/1355981318932/?format=original" border="0" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Though there's more to the story.  There's something far more important to me than all of this, and that's the elusive Mysterious Dottie.</p>
<p>I'll be blunt and say Mysterious Dottie is the most important thing in the world to me.  It's that thing when I wake up every morning I say "what do I have to do today in order to give this to the world?"  And one of the things I have to do is be able to continue doing the work I'm doing now, and not getting a "real job".</p>
<p>Though simple math says otherwise.  From me miss-estimating the scope of projects (therefore getting underpaid), to clients flat out not being able to pay, I can't say I've been hugely successful. I'm not convinced with the amount I've been charging clients I can afford to continue on this path. On the flip side, if I don't It's really the death toll for Mysterious Dottie.  So things like increasing what I charge and trying to pick up larger projects are all things I'm trying to do not for myself, but because I feel that passionate about getting this out to the world.</p>
<p>I feel I can be honest and filter out all the butterflies and rainbows and tell you that the story of Mysterious Dottie has not been an easy one.  There is not a day that goes by where I don't completely doubt myself, doubt any execution success, and doubt the direction I've taken.  But I'm so determined to do everything I can to get this fucker launched that I put it all aside and fight through all of that.</p>
<p>Why the doubt?  I'm at a different level of emotional investment than anyone else who have required parts to play.  I care about every piece of the puzzle, and to others it's just another project on their plate.  And generally as far as priority it's quite far down on said plate.  It's very casual to everyone but me.  But to me it's my all or nothing.</p>
<p>I've told myself that if I don't launch the product by fall then that's the end for it, and me.  If it isn't going to be what I hoped for it, then I have to give up that dream and be more rational.  I'll get a real job, I'll be responsible, and I'll say I did everything I could to make it come true, but failed.  But there is no plan B, there is no second chance.  This is that thing I've worked up to my whole life, and if I don't see it through, then I'll pat myself on the back for taking the risk but realize that time in my life is over.</p>
<p>That being said: That's the last thing I want to happen.  But I also realize it's probably the most likely scenario.  Every piece of the puzzle that has to come together for success has in some way come disjointed.  It's taken far too long for far too little progress and at this rate by fall I'll be nowhere near a completed project.  Also the fall deadline was originally due to TechCrunch50, a conference to allow new companies to launch.  That's the reason for the code name and the stealth mode, it's a TC50 requirement.  However it seems as TC50 will not be existing this year, and I have no other launch vehicle.</p>
<p>So that's that.  What my life has consisted of.  Don't get me wrong, I consider myself one of the luckiest people ever to be able to take this path.  But at the same time I worry every day that I'll never be able to realize my potential with it all.  So if this post sounds like I'm venting, or I'm down... well, maybe. There are ups and downs to everything and everyone. But more so I think i've been quiet, and people have asked, so I think it's fair to let people know what I've been up to.  Cross your fingers and let's see what happens!</p>
<p>(btw this post was completely composed using my iPad!)</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Dear Gabe,1: You should add Discus commenting to this.. I like that.
2: As a person who suffered a huge developmental setback because I was stabbed in the back by my bestest friend in the whole wide world.. even though it was totally my fault.. anyway.. I know what it's like to lose hope. In fact, people have been calling me Hopeless for as long as I can remember.. however, YOU should not give up hope. So what if your previous launch vehicle is gone? Does your project no longer have a market? Does it no longer solve a problem? If your project is still of value, if only even to you, you owe it to yourself.. and to me, for fuck's sake, to finish it and show it off for the world to see! 
Never give up on your dreams! One day you won't have any choices left and you'll only look back in regret. Believe you me, I've been there.</p>
<p>Peace out, home skillet!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>1. Mysterious Dottie is the best code name ever.  I hope that name sticks post-launch.
2. Goals are awesome. Deadlines are good.  Ultimatums are not so good.  The nature of every human is to underestimate and the nature of every startup is to hit every pot-hole.  Keep looking for other ways to keep making love to Dottie even if Fall comes and goes.</p>
<p>3. If Dottie turns out not to be your one-true-love, don't resign yourself to a cube for eternity.  If you're stubborn, you can bootstrap the next idea in the off-hours (whether the on-hours are freelance or cube)...</p>
<p>Keep going dude.

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Gabe, here's another vote for never give up. I struggled to get my degree while working full time. It took me 7 1/2 years and I wanted to give up so many times. In the end, it became a personal quest to finish simply because it was something I had put so much time into and I wanted to prove to myself I could do it. When I finally did finish, it was one if the happiest days of my life.
I think the feeling of accomplishment stems from being challenged, struggling, and eventually overcoming. Based on how you described your current situation, I'd say it sounds like you are on the right track.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I can't even pretend to be an expert at anything. I dabble and try and then dive in headfirst. These tendencies have led me to great successes and great failures.From me to you- stay freelance! There are sooooo many online outlets to finding work. I use iFreelance.com a lot and various other sites. For the most part, I haven't had problems with the projects that have come to me from that way. 
I will side with Skid Vis on the friend issue. Trusting friends can be the best and worst when it comes to your livelihood. When someone throws you a bone and isn't serious about it. You are left holding the bag that was supposed to be full of money (ie: your fee). Been there!!! </p>
<p>All of that aside. This is a completely serious offer.... I would love to help you in any way that I can to find a launch platform for your "project". I'm not asking for information before you are ready to reveal either. I'll simply point you in the right direction for your startup and help out however you ask me to. </p>
<p>THAT is what friends are for. I admire you greatly for your courage and hope that I may one day be as capable and as successful in my own ventures as you have been in yours. </p>

      <title>TechStars for a Day, startup culture, and my comparisons to Omaha</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/05/techstars-for-a-day</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright, <strong>stay with me</strong>.  I promise you'll get something at the end.  I don't promise you'll like it, though.
I attended <a href="http://www.techstars.org/techstars-for-a-day/">TechStars for a Day</a> in Seattle.  If you want to know what this rockin' organization <a href="http://www.techstars.org/details/">does check it out</a>.  But in short, they are a business accelerator.  Get your company off the ground in the most awesome way possible.</p>
<p>It seemed like a classic case of serendipity. I was behind the controls at Big Omaha helping the speakers tell their inspiring stories when an email invite came in from TechStars to join them in Seattle to hear more about the program and to give them an opportunity to meet me. It was at this point I was faced with a very important decision: jump up in excitement or let Tony Hsieh finish his talk. History shows what path I took, I didn't interrupt, and everyone got a free book. So good on me for that one.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to expect. The only person I'd ever met that's gone through the TechStars program was Matt Galligan from SimpleGeo. I used the opportunity of Big Omaha to ask him what he thought of it after going through it. He recommended I absolutely make it to Seattle to see what the inaugural Seattle TechStars class has to offer.</p>
<p>So Sunday I jumped on a plane and headed to Seattle feeling not just as a representative of #MysteriousDottie, but maybe as an unofficial spokesperson of Omaha for a day as well.</p>
<p>Showing up Monday morning I met so many people.  All seeming to fit in a category of person that I honestly can't say I've really met before.  They are passionate about launching or improving on something awesome.  Everyone had an idea and regardless of what happened that day, what happened in the past, or what happens with TechStars or otherwise they are going to launch this particular thing that means so much to them.</p>
<p>Even though these companies are all technology based there was zero talk of tech.  Nobody asked me "so what are you building your company with?" or asked my opinion on web frameworks.  No side discussions about browsers, operating systems or programming languages.  Nobody cared.  If you were to ask someone the (increasingly awful) question "What do you do?" you won't hear "I'm a ruby on rails developer" but instead "I run a company that does X."  I always joked with @lasertron that her title in the world was "Textiles Engineer" and that seems to be a parallel to these business owners.  She's as much of a engineer of fabric as these people are programmers.  It's a means to an end to build something completely radical.</p>
<p>I won't lie, there was an air of competition.  I want to guess there were maybe 30 companies in attendance, between one and four people per company.  This however is very narrowed down from the hundreds that apply from all around the world.  While each person there is supportive and excited for everyone else, they all want to be a member of the final ten companies that will be selected in June.</p>
<p>An example: Andy Sack, the director of TechStars in Seattle, mentioned he had forgot his camera and asked if anyone in attendance had a camera that wasn't a camera-phone.  I was the only person to raise my hand.  I was dubbed the official TechStars for a day photographer and I did my best to make sure I captured the event.  Though unexpectedly I got a few people telling me that it was a "good move" to volunteer to take pictures and get an "in" with the TechStars committee.  Honestly, that was the last thing that came to mind when raising my hand to say I had a camera but others saw it as a strategic move.</p>
<p>I got to meet a handful of mentors and past TechStars companies.  Urbanspoon, Feedburner and Everlater were in attendance.  There's something really great to be hanging out casually with the team from Urbanspoon, asking them specific questions about their mobile development strategies.</p>
<p>So enough about facts and what I saw.  You're here for my thoughts.  So here are my personal reflections.</p>
<p>To me it felt like I was taking Big Omaha a step further.  Where just a couple weeks ago I was being told to follow my dream, an event like this with knowledgeable, real world tested companies were pointing me in a direction to do so.  From founders openly discussing the mistakes they made to groups saying openly they really had no idea how to program before embarking on the path to their idea it opens up a layer of "realness" and detail to each person telling their story.</p>
<p>Much like me when I decided I wanted to build something awesome you start developing more questions than answers and our local community is lacking on those answers.  Having people be completely transparent in detail about not only the things they've done right, but also what they've done wrong helps so much when giving people the tools they need to launch the next really great thing.  Now that I see the startup community of Seattle (and before that TechStars having Boulder and Boston classes) I hope Omaha starts making the steps to go that direction as well.  But as I've mentioned to others Omaha is slightly in a chicken and egg situation.  In order for people to open up about how they launched something great we need a handful of something greats to launch.  And for that to happen there is that possibility that the best scenario is to leave the area.</p>
<p>I know, the infamous least popular opinion of all of Big Omaha.  But you'd be surprised how many mentors and successful business owners in Seattle told me how I need to get into a bigger pond.  And I'll stick by the thought that for some people it is a valid choice.  Until Omaha has a culture that strives to enable people to succeed in their dreams not just in great community (that we have), but in experienced mentors and investments that are geared to the startup sector, people may be spinning their wheels.  Sorry.  &lt;3 you guys.</p>
<p>I don't say that to stir controversy, but more to be appreciative that these types of things exist.  The opportunity for someone like me, just some random dude in Omaha, to visit, if only for a day, is a great thing.  I encourage any of you if you have an idea and some first steps on executing it to apply to TechStars, or <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a> or local institutions like the <a href="http://haloinstitute.org/">Halo Institute</a>.  Maybe it'll be the move for you to take your idea to the next level.  Maybe it'll be a complete waste of your time.  For me even if I never hear from TechStars again just the application process and being a part of the club for one day was worth the effort.  You learn something just trying.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Equilibrium had it right</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/07/equilibrium-had-it-right</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm a person of logic.  Things that I don't see I don't believe.  Things that don't make sense I don't assume to be true.  Faith isn't really a thing I take part in, and I do things when I see a reason to.
I let logic determine my decisions in life, but unfortunately there's circumstance where not only do I let that slide, but it goes completely in the other direction.  Doctors call that little issue of mine "major depressive disorder" and it's something i've battled my whole life.  The part of me when I let things that I know shouldn't bother me to bother me, and where I make decisions not based on logic but instead on faulty emotion.  Emotion isn't logic.</p>
<p>I had to leave Twitter.  At least for a while.  I was unable to continue to watch people's worlds literally scroll by me.  For every Tweet that said "I'm so happy!" I only think "fuck you."  For every "I love the summer and my friends!" I think "I hate when people are happy."  I sit home and read about how happy others are, even though I know the filter of the internet makes things often look better or worse than they really are.  It effects me far too much.</p>
<p>I cut out Facebook.  At least for a while.  I found myself commenting on things and saying things I regret later.  I'm only spreading the emotion-based hate to others.  That's not fair.</p>
<p>You don't know how much this pisses me off.  Me feeling things that I know are 100% illogical.  I have no reason to be "down" or "unhappy".  I know I am because of faulty neurons not sucking up enough serotonin in my brain.  I realize that's a fault of my body just like if I were born blind, or my right arm didn't work, or whatever.  It's just a thing.  Though it grabs me so fucking hard and I can't shake it.  </p>
<p>So as I try to and I cut out the internet activities that pushed me in the first place I realized something.  I wasn't just cutting out the "I'm so happy!!" comments that made me so down, but I'm cutting out the people.  And the sad part is cutting out the people really makes things better.</p>
<p>Shortly after pulling myself away from the digital world and the many hundreds of people that inhabited it every day all of a sudden my expectations were reduced of that world.  If you remove the people you consider "friends", you don't get disappointed.  Being alone isn't any longer "I wish I was out with people right now" but instead "I wonder what new podcasts are online."  The expectation of friendship and happiness is removed when the people are removed.</p>
<p>To me, that's a great feeling.  If you look at me a year ago I had a lot of great friends I spent a lot of time with.  In that year so many things have changed.  Every person I considered a close friend has moved forward with their life and into a world I don't inhabit.  Cohabitation in relationships, marriages, births, moves out of the area, etc.  The world has moved fast this past year and that's not a bad thing.  But unfortunately it is something that ignites the faulty emotional part of me and makes me react with "I don't care how much fun you're having at the beach, shut up" when the Twitpic gets uploaded.</p>
<p>I hope everyone is well.  I apologize 100 times over for "being that way" and I honestly hope everyone is having the best summer of their lives.  Maybe you can tell me about it some time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I was wondering where you went. I suppose this explains that. It is absolutely terrible being that person who doesn't seem to fit anywhere, and I certainly know how that can be. And although I'm basically just an internet buddy for you, if you ever want to talk, you know where to reach me. Also, if you ever want cookies, I can probably do that. (Raisins need not apply.)</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey there Gabe,I was just wondering where you went to one morning...and I guess I found that out. Everyone has their battles. I personally battle with severe anxiety so I know how easily it can be to get sucked into others' emotions and let them affect you in such a way. It's all a battle, life...and I'm glad that you're fighting and doing what you can for yourself. So good job on figuring out what you needed to do, even if it was cutting out the internet others for a while. Also, thanks for sharing because it shows your strength and helps others with different problems realize their strength. 
Thanks Gabe</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Gabe, you rip my heart out. I admire your openness to share this, you are braver than I ever have been. Everyone's struggle is different, so I won't claim that I know everything about what you're going through, but I've been fighting my own lifelong struggle with anxiety and depression (atypical to your major) so I have a small glimpse. I know how terrible it is not to have control of your own emotions, how isolating it can be, and how helpless it makes you feel. Hang in there - I hope that you find your equilibrium, and if you ever need a sympathetic ear, don't hesitate to ask.
You're already following the only advice, one recovering off-kilter mind to another, that I can offer: do whatever you need to get better. Whatever illogical, harsh, hard, or crazy things you need to do to keep things in check, do them. Stay tight with your friends, do what you need to regardless of what everyone's expectations are, and keep up hope - it's a slow process. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find a way to joy.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>#TheCabin Mobile for iPhone</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/09/thecabin-mobile</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've always said if I took all the time and effort I spent into side projects and spent them on something else I'd have a lot of cool other things.  But I've spent some nights and weekends working on this new little app, my first submission to the iTunes App Store.  (Approved in 8 days, FYI)
As some of you may know, for the past 15 years I've been helping manage an internet relay chat (IRC) channel I started called #TheCabin.  Recently I finished up an app called <a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thecabin-mobile/id395148231?mt=8">#TheCabin Mobile</a> for iOS.</p>
<p>The project, as most of my projects are, was to create something to do the things I couldn't do easily before.</p>
<p>The first feature I really wanted:  Easy sharing of photos directly to the channel.
Previously in order to share a photo I'd do the following:
* Open up the camera app
* Take a photo
* Open up dropbox or CloudApp
* Upload the photo to a public place, copy the URL of the image
* Open the IRC client
* Paste the URL into the channe.</p>
<p>Now within the app there are two options: Take new photo, use old photo.  You select one, type something about it, and off it goes for all your (my) friends to enjoy.  I already find myself using and loving it.</p>
<p>Of course I had to integrate a quick way to jump directly into the channel.  Most of us hardcore cabiners (those who hang out there) already have our multitudes of mobile IRC options, but I wanted something for a first timer, just downloading the app from the app store, to jump into the channel as easy as possible.  To do this I use a few different web based IRC clients.  None of them are perfect, unfortunately, so that one that's best for you at the time can be selected from the options in the app.</p>
<p>It lists on the main screen who's currently in the channel, and you can view Tweets/Facebook updates from cabiners who've been posting.  You're also one tap away from reading #TheCabin Wiki (the r33tipedia).</p>
<p>So is this app for everyone?  Or anyone but me?  Probably not.  <a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thecabin-mobile/id395148231?mt=8">But it's up on the iTunes App Store</a> if you want to come hang out with my friends and I.  I don't recommend it.</p>
<p><a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thecabin-mobile/id395148231?mt=8"><img title="TheCabinMobileITMS" height="300" alt="" width="229" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1788" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a039/1355981318975/?format=original" /></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Lost and Found: A video experiment started in 2006</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/10/3685</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2006 I was diligently working on my (still unreleased) new album "The Longest Post". With that I decided to create a couple music videos both as an experiment on if I could make something fun, and to have a visual way to distribute some songs.
A couple apartment moves later and the hard drives with the music videos were lost.</p>
<p>Until now. In October, 2010 I found the hard drives while cleaning out my music studio and decided it was time to show them to the world.</p>
<p>They weren't completely finished, however. But a couple nights of some polish and fixes made it so the first, "Got Skillz?" could be released. And here it is.</p>
<p>Some things of note:
You can tell it's from 2007. Old school web pages and apps. You see an old version of YouTube complete with a greasemonkey script changing the background color of it running within an old version of Firefox.  I was running a lot more extensions then than I remember.</p>
<p>Also given the lack of resources as far as what video I had to work with I experimented with using the game/app/world of "Second Life" for some of the character stuff to emulate the "party in the computer" vibe.</p>
<p>The video "Got Skillz?" tells the story of the party inside the computer. The song says "Get off the floor, and get on the net. The dance you see there is unbelievable I bet." and the video shows it to be true.</p>
<p>It also mocks the world of rap music by itself being a rap song, but showing how the character of Real-ity doesn't belong in the ghetto with the homies and would probably just find the nearest computer and get online.</p>
<p>See below for a "behind the scenes" video from when I was working on this originally (February 2007).</p>

      <title>Weekly Song Recommendation: Mark Mallman - Mother Made Me Do It</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/10/weekly-song-recommendation-mark-mallman-mother-made-me-do-it</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven't done a music recommendation post in a while.  It's certainly not weekly, but I'm not changing the naming.  I don't know, stopped feeling inspired, I guess.
Well fuck if I don't feel inspired now.</p>
<p>I've always been a fan of Mark Mallman's.  It started, like many of artists I enjoy do, seeing a show of theirs without knowing who they were beforehand.  This is a prime example of the Gabe Kangas music/movie introduction theory.  It is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don't miss the previews.  One of the new movies may be your new favorite movie ever.
Don't miss the opening act.  You're going to the show anyway and they may be your new favorite band.
Don't just go for the opener.  The headliner may your new favorite band.  You're there anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VW8SV5HCL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="126" /></p>
<p>Simple enough.</p>
<p>That was in Chicago.  Last fall I was in Seattle and Mallman happened to have a show at a club there a night I was free, so of course I went.  Loved it like the first time.  Grabbed the newest cd.</p>
<p>And then all was quiet until this weekend.  Mark Mallman presented Marathon 3: The 78 hour song.</p>
<p>Live from The Turf Club he played music 78 hours straight.  Him, along side his 400 page binder of lyrics he had prepared, rocked it.  The backing band would change every hour, and aside from ~1min bathroom breaks (while the song continued via the band) and the time a doctor pulled him off the stage (he sprained his ankle... and that whole not sleeping for 78hrs thing) he was on stage playing his song.</p>
<p>I can't really recap it in all its glory, since I wasn't physically there.  But through the magic of Twitter and the live video stream of the event I was pretty invested.  But if you're at all interested check out the <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2010/10/mark_mallman_ma_2.php">liveblog via CityPages</a>.  Here's a photo they took:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2010/10/mark_mallman_ma_2.php"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/Mallman-Marathon-D4-14_52_35.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="376" /></a></p>
<p>But I must say, watching this thing go down was a firsthand ticket to a man's journey into madness.  While his first couple days of 24/7 rocking looked like they didn't take a toll on him, this last day I could no longer decipher the genius from the madness.  His banter with the band started to consist of "I weigh 600 pounds, I think I'm going to die.  This isn't healthy."  He had a conversation with his dead grandmother.  He talked to his guitar player about going to Bennigan's to eat, but realized they were out of business.  It just kept getting weirder.  His voice was going out as time went on and I wasn't sure if he was going to make it the full 78 hours.  I mean, look at the guy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/Mallman-Marathon-D4-17_50_53.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="376" /></p>
<p>But he did.  And it was awesome.</p>
<p>So in the honor of a man who when asked why he would do something so crazy replied with "because", I recommend you check out this song from his "Live from First Avenue" album, the first album of his I got.  I like it because it has that live energy that I experienced this weekend remotely, but... you know, coherent.</p>
<p>If only everyone loved their craft so much they wanted to see what the extreme of it consisted of.</p>

      <title>Barcamp 2010: The Musical</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/11/barcamp-2010-the-musical</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been thinking about what I wanted to do for Barcamp this year.  I was chatting over lunch today with this week's Coworking Wednesday participants about how I wished there was something different I could do.  Something collaborative and break the mold of what an unconference session should be.  I mentioned music stuff and @whatevermatt mentioned a drum circle.
I thought about that a while (at least 2 to 3 minutes) later that day (today) and thought I'd see if I could pull something off.  So here's an attempt to get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session">jam session</a> rocking at Barcamp.</p>
<p>So here's a call to all Barcamp participants who have access to any kind of simple, acoustic, portable instrument that is jam-able (hammered dulcimer, Roland 808: maybe not so much.  Think hand drum, acoustic guitar, rain sticks, stand-up bass, iPhone, didgeridoo, you get the idea.)</p>
<p>And don't worry, I already talked to @lasertron about a way to do it so speakers don't get upset: she suggested to have it at lunch!</p>
<p>This is informal, and it'd be cool for as many people to join in who are willing.  If you have any extra gear at home that might be appropriate for this, bring it!  I'll bring what I have as well.</p>
<p>Tell your friends!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Also thanks to everyone to indulged me in my attempt for a lunchtime jam session.  I can't honestly say it was the most musical thing ever performed, but we all had fun anyway :)  Thanks to everyone who took part!  It was nice to mix things up a bit.</p>

      <title>2010 Year in Review</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/12/2010-year-in-review</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was planning on doing the @lasertron Radvent project more than I did, but after the first few I wasn't able to resonate with it anymore.  They involved things that didn't make sense to me.  Either making things, or interacting with people.  Christmas parties, neighbors, etc.  I didn't have any of these and I felt pretty lame.  So instead I figured i'd write this blog post about 2010.
I wish I could say I have a lot of detailed things to talk about that happened in the past year, but I really don't.  It's been a year that has been focused on just a couple things, and It's been a year of removing anything that diluted the focus.</p>
<p>I guess I lost a lot of friends this past year.  I couldn't tell you exactly why.  Some I've purposely cut out as a way to get away from people and/or situations I find distracting or making me unhappy.  Others have quietly slipped away from my life, maybe citing the same reasons, who knows.  Though this year I found I need to step away from unhappiness due to the hands of others.  And I had a really awful Summer that involved some of that.  I even told my parents during a visit this year that they're not allowed to come back.  I'll stand by that.  I learned unhappiness due to guilt or association is stupid.</p>
<p>While I say I haven't done anything exciting this year, it's not entirely true.  I mean, <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2010/05/techstars-for-a-day">I went to Seattle to visit the TechStars program for frack sake</a>.  How cool is that?</p>
<p>I also was able to go to <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2010/03/sxsw201">South By Southwest </a> for the first time.  Something I've always wanted to do.  Just being in attendance and meeting people doing awesome things, and hearing people's ideas, and watching things in action is really a jump to anything you might be doing.  I'm really looking forward to SxSW 2011, hopefully bringing my own passion and ideas in tow.</p>
<p>I thought maybe this past year would have included me working on more music, but again, my passion and focus was elsewhere, so unfortunately a lot of the tunes I hoped to some day finish is again being pushed into the next year.  Maybe 2011 will see the completion of my mysterious album.  Though I am releasing tracks as they get finished, so I suppose I'll give myself a little credit there.  <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2010/10/3685">Plus I was able to finally put out the music video for "Got Skillz?" all these years later</a>.  Something from 2006 finally online?  That's pretty cool.</p>
<p>Also being that I left West Corporation at the very end of last year, 2010 was also thus far the entirety of my freelance/consulting work.</p>
<p>For the most part, I can't complain.  I've made some neat projects and really done my best.  Though the output of the process has been a complete failure.  As of this writing 55% of my invoiced total have not been paid.  If you think that's an impressively high number...YES it's a high number.  Some of it i've written off as "I'll never get it, so I'm not going to fight it any longer", and some of it I'm actively fighting.  A lot of that number comes from clients "unable" to pay me due to their client not paying them in some shape or form.  And this isn't just a single client, there's multiple.  So I'm thinking it's just part of the game.  Sometimes you luck out and get paid, sometimes you don't.  My advice if you're going into consulting work, only do it if you love it, because you'll be doing it for free most of the time.</p>
<p>So I don't know.  Do I have other things to wrap up from the year?  Probably.  I'm just doing this off the cuff.</p>
<p>I hope you're all having a great holiday season, and I hope to catch up with you all soon in the new year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So @lasertron is doing a thing, beginning with her blog over at <a href="http://www.princesslasertron.com">PrincessLasertron.com</a>, where she's issuing a blog topic every day throughout the month of December.  She asked some others if they'd be willing to join her, and here I am.
I'm not so bold to think I'll actually blog every day this month, but I'll try.</p>
<p>Enough of that, here's #1.  @lasertron writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a03f/1355981319066/?format=original"><img title="remembering_radvent" height="300" alt="" width="231" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13648" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a042/1355981319078/?format=original" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a03f/1355981319066/?format=original">W</a>hat were you doing five years ago today?
Where were you?
Who were you with?
What did you want?
What did you have?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Lucky me, I get the "bad remembering" part of the writing exercise.  Five years ago I was living with my ex in Illinois, planning our wedding and getting ready for the holiday season.  If you know me and my thoughts about weddings and holidays you're cringing right now at the thought of reading this post.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Almost everything at this point in time revolved around the whole wedding thing.  Our trip to Vegas, the reception to be held in Marquette, MI afterwards.  Who was coming?  What are the travel arrangements?  Was the venue paid for?  Did you contact the cake lady?  Blah blah blah.  All that shit that people <strong>think </strong>is important at that time in life, but are really just trivial details that won't ever matter again.  Weddings are such crap.  All that money wasted to prove to others 1) How much you "love each other", 2) How big of a party you can throw, 3) How much better you are than everyone else, 4) How creative you are.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What did I want?  Honestly, I wanted the holiday and the wedding to be over with.  As an adult I've never enjoyed Christmas time.  Spending time with my family is not something I enjoy.  The "you spend it with those of genetic resemblance to you because you have to" thing never really jived with me, but I was able to deal at this point in time because I had a partner in crime.  I didn't have to sit in the corner alone feeling like I wanted it to be over, I had at least someone to talk to when visiting my family.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And what did I have?  I don't know.  I guess I had the same things anyone that is just about to celebrate christmas and get married have.  Annoyances, bills and a bride-to-be who may not be exceptionally easy to work with.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'll do my best to be less bitter next time.  This one is kind of a hot button for me, and I apologize.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Radvent Dec 3 - Sexy notes to yourself</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/12/radvent-dec-3-sexy-notes-to-yourself</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a051/1355981319171/?format=original"><img title="radventdec3_writing" height="300" alt="" width="232" class="size-medium wp-image-14032  aligncenter" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a054/1355981319188/?format=original" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Write a letter of love to yourself to read again in one year.
And then some stuff that has to do with getting away from the computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">If you haven't noticed, I'm going to ignore the parts of this project that deals with getting away from the computer and doing things.  That's not really my jam.  Journal, stamps, special pens, beautiful paper, stickers, glue, etc... not things I own.  I write with the tool I'm using right now.  Little buttons and a little screen.  I'm not much for using a pen or paper.  It bugs me enough that I have to sign credit card receipts.  Can't you scan my retina or something?  It's 2010, at least pretend that we're evolved beings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyway.  I think I'll do this one.  I'll write a love letter to myself later today.  I'll save it as a private post here on my blog, and in a year I'll read it again.  Maybe even let you read it too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A love letter to myself.  This is going to be hot.  Dirty boy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Radvent Dec 5 - #Radvent tunage</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/12/radvent-dec-5-radvent-tunage</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a057/1355981319245/?format=original"><img title="radventdec5_rockingout" height="300" alt="" width="232" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14617" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a05a/1355981319292/?format=original" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;">Create the soundtrack of your year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now THIS is more like it!  Though to be honest I feel like I talk about music to people so often I don't know what to put here that's worth reading.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's actually pretty easy for me to find what I've been listening to this past year because of Last.FM.  <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Gabek/charts?rangetype=year&amp;subtype=artists" target="_blank">In fact here is my 12 month chart in detail.</a> However, this year I haven't really been "into" anything significantly like most years.  It's certainly been a soundtrack of a year built of previous years and a couple new discoveries.  But unlike years where I can say "I was really into Daft Punk" or "I discovered the new pornographers this year" this year has been a pretty casual listening time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course Nine Inch Nails has been a staple, but there's nothing new there.  Though I really enjoy any live releases that happen to come out from shows, so there's generally always been something new to listen to.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ghostland Observatory came out with a new album this year, "Codename: Rondo" and I've given that a few e-rotations.  They ended up pretty high in my list with 119 plays.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Crystal Castles also came out with a new release this year, and I've played them a bit.  Well, only 85 times.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I went to see Lords of Acid this year, and around that time I was playing them quite a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Blaqk Audio is an electronic dancey group that I never would have heard of if @andrea_joi didn't suggest them to me.  They get a pretty constant play rate in my rotation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you organize my music <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Gabek/charts?rangetype=year&amp;subtype=tracks" target="_blank">by what tracks I listened to the most</a> it gets even a little more broad.  Is that Semisonic's 2001 hit "Chemistry" way up on the charts?  Yes it is.  And that, my friends, shows you that it's been kind of a down year when it comes to tunes for me.  (Don't get me wrong, I really like that song.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For some reason "Shiny Toy Guns" was a staple this year as well.  But that's some feel-good, fun time poppy dance tunes that I can't go wrong with.  So who would blame me?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you look at albums I've listened to the most, I think it's a pretty good list.  We start with Blaqk Audio's SexCells, as mentioned before.  A couple soundtracks, including <em>Repo!  The Genetic Opera.</em> And the <strong>awesome</strong> comedy album by The Lonely Island, Incredibad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also as far as albums we have that new album by Ghostland Obervatory I mentioned, The Dance Macbre Remix album by The Faint, Daft Punk's Discovery, and Battles' Mirrored.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I've heard Battles in previous years, but it was just this year I got their album "Mirrored", and it's really great stuff.  Highly recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To close things out I'll point you to songs that I've been recommending, as they are a great example of music I've loved at that point in time.  So seriously head over to <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a05d/1355981319443/?format=original">http://gabekangas.com/musicrecommendations</a> to hear some tunes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know this post wasn't very deep or anything, but hey.  What do you expect?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Below I'll embed a few sources of tunes probably mentioned above, and you can partake if you like.  Enjoy!</p>

      <title>Boulder Startup Week 2011</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/05/boulder-startup-week-2011</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So on the recommendation of my friend @sethhwilson in the hour before the deadline I half-assed an email to @ryanwanger of Boulder Startup Week for their "We'll fly you to Boulder free" offer.  They were going to hand pick a handful of people and bring them in for the event.  I honestly kind of forgot about it, and I really only did it as one of those "take advantage of opportunity because you never know" kind of things that I'm trying to be proactive about.  Logic says nothing will come of it due to too many other people being involved, but lo and behold I got a call a few days later asking if I'd like a free flight to Boulder, Colorado for Boulder Startup Week.
I had already planned a trip to San Francisco in a few weeks, and work was piling up, so logically I should had said that too many things coming up in order for me to go.  But much like the reason I sent the email in the first place I went ahead and took advantage of the opportunity and said "Really?  me?  Well, ok.  I'm in."  The trip was booked and they found someone for me to stay with while I was there.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to expect, as I didn't know anyone who lived there, and I had no idea what was going on there.  I knew it as the home of TechStars, and that's really about it.  So with no expectations I figured I had very little chance of disappointment.  Little did I know there was no way for me to be disappointed by Boulder and its people.</p>
<p>The events for the week were loosely organized.  There was a central schedule, but anyone could organize an event and have it be added.  Some were very tech focused like "The Mobile Web and Why it Sucks".  Others had nothing to do with tech like the "Pizzeria tour and Tasting".  And then there was the immensely fun, 1300 people packed house edition of "Ignite Boulder".  I've heard of Ignite events in cities, but it was my first chance attending one.  It was so much fun.  The whole city was excited for it, and I came out understanding what the fuss was about.</p>
<p>But to be honest the events had little to do with my Boulder adventure.  It was the people and the culture that made it special.</p>
<p>Everyone was happy to meet me.  I think there was a certain novelty when they found out I was one of the few chosen for the "free flight" deal.  But the people were extremely welcoming to me from the second I set foot on Boulder soil.</p>
<p>The first thing of notice, when I met new people they all asked the same thing: "Are you moving here?"  I found that very odd.  Why would they think because I'm visiting they expect that I'm moving there?  I'd simply respond to the question, with a "no... I'm just visiting, I have no intention to move anywhere."</p>
<p>People were genuinely excited when I told them about Hollrback and the other work that I do.  They wanted to know more.  They wanted to be involved.  They made me feel special.</p>
<p>Speaking of Hollrback: Boulder likes Hollrback.  They've actually heard of it before.  Can you imagine the smile on my face when I walk into the TechStars bunker and someone from the TechStars class said "oh yeah, I know you guys."  Something about Boulder made me feel like a founder of a "real" startup, not someone pretending to be someone he once read about in TechCrunch.</p>
<p>At this point I'm not going to go into detail about everyone I met, or everything I did.  That would make this post kind of lame.  However, some things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was in the Denver airport when Britney Riley texted me with "Brad McCarty just told the pitch session attendees that Hollrback is one of his new favorite products."  Holy shit.  He told that group... a group of people who are doing awesome things, that he respects Hollrback?  Wow.  He also mentioned Hollrback in a couple tweets over the startup week.  Seriously, the US editor of The Next Web telling people that he influences that Hollrback is rad.  Mind.Blown.  Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/bradmccarty/status/72091342364344320">this tweet</a>.</li>
<li>Andrew Hyde seeing my tweets online and replying to me because he knew I was in Boulder.  I also got to have lunch with him and hang out quite a few times chatting.</li>
<li>People like Chris Vieville, Marissa Berlin, Cali Harris, Ryan Angilly and so many others would see me at events and make sure to say hi to me.</li>
<li>Having Dave Taylor sit next to me at Atlas Purveyors and then realize after "Hey, that was the <a href="http://www.askdavetaylor.com/">askdavetaylor.com</a> guy!"</li>
<li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jerry-lewis/boulder-entrepreneurial-density_b_864522.html">I got quoted in Huffington Post</a> after I spoke to a journalist at the Startup Week opening party.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, that's enough of that.  I could spend all day talking about the culture, the environment and opportunities for startups such as mine and the atmosphere that the people create.  I could compare and contrast to Omaha, but instead I'll thank those who made the week possible:  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/elaineellis">Elaine Ellis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/andrewhyde">Andrew Hyde</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pug">Ef Rodriguez</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ryanwanger">Ryan Wanger</a> who coordinated us out-of-towners.</p>
<p>Oh, and after a while when asked "Are you moving here?" I started to say "Maybe".  And I meant it.</p>
<p>Here's a video I threw together of some things I captured while at the event.  I put no time into it, and it's not very exciting.  I didn't grab as much content digitally as I should have.  It features some clips/photos  from Ignite Boulder, Boulder Open Coffee Club, and some of the other events.  Here you go!</p>

I was saying "yes" to that question by the time I left (in fact, was looking at housing before I arrived) and in the end decided that as I came home (yeah, home) to Omaha, that what I really wanted to do was somehow bring just a bit of that intoxicating excitement back with me. </p>

      <title>Embarrassment is embarrassing.</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/10/embarrassment-is-embarrassing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven't updated many people on what i've been up to lately.  And there's a simple reason for that: embarrassment.  <strong>It's not fun to talk about being a failure</strong>.  Part of me didn't want to be dramatic in telling a story and having people read into things, but I'll try to be a little more transparent and see where that gets me.
Maybe the last thing you knew was that Hollrback launched, I was traveling around talking to amazing people about it, and getting awesome feedback.  And then things kind of hit a brick wall.  I ran out of money to sustain myself, and I knew that if I could no longer eat or have a place to live that Hollrback would ultimately suffer.  So I made the really hard choice to give up with ad-hoc projects and dedicated Hollrback efforts and get a "real job" in order to keep things afloat.</p>
<p><strong>This is how I failed Hollrback.  This is how I failed Omaha.  This is how I failed my friends that had faith in me</strong>.  I had to cave and push Hollrback aside in order to survive, in order for Hollrback to survive.  I was once told by a representative of a local tech blog that Hollrback was no longer a "company", but a "small side project" due to the fact that I had to get a job.  <strong>I was completely crushed</strong>.  I'll never forget that feeling, Hollrback was now seen differently because I needed to be able to pay rent.  Now I wake up every morning, look in the mirror and see a fuckup.   Everything negative that comes to me I've seen since then as justifiable punishment for not being good at what I do.  If you've never been there I don't expect you to understand.</p>
<p>I really, really tried.  It's really, really hard.</p>
<p>This was months ago.  As time went on deadlines took time away from what I was passionate about and put energy into what I had to do.  Don't get me wrong, my job is great.  I'm building some neat stuff for neat people.  <strong>But Hollrback was getting farther away from me every day</strong>.  I didn't know what to do next.</p>
<p>I was alone with a product that I saw as something the world could really use, and I had no idea what to do with it.  It wasn't about money, it only had to do with <strong>my inability to do anything successfully</strong>.  I have no idea what I'm doing, and I've been pretty honest about it if you've ever approached and asked me.</p>
<p>Early on I was pretty confident I would build a great product, but I had no idea how to build a great business.  So my plan was to surround myself with people that would work with me on that journey.  Ultimately when it came down to it none of that really worked out. Not for any reason in particular, it's just hard.  Everyone involved has been top notch and I think highly of them.  But once I found myself stuck I put all pride aside and started to contact people that I respected, and others I didn't know but who others respected.  Some pushed me aside, others replied with an <strong>"it's ok to fail"</strong>.</p>
<p>And that's what you're thinking right now, aren't you?  <strong>I get it a lot</strong>.  "That's too bad.  What are you going to work on next?"  I feel pretty strongly that if you had something you were ready to jump on at the first sight of strife that you never really cared that much about what you were doing in the first place.  I don't have a plan B or a "next idea".  What's wrong with this one?  It's not Hollrback who failed.  It's me.  It's just me.</p>
<p>In my mind I ask a series of simple questions.  "Is Hollrback pretty great?  Yes.  Does people think highly of it?  Yes.  Do people want it to succeed?  Yes.  Is there a competitor in the space that has succeeded where Hollrback could not?  No."  If any of the answers were any different than those<strong> I'd gladly pack up my code and move on</strong>.  But Hollrback is bigger than myself.  It has nothing to do with me, my success, or me being right or wrong.  It's about giving something to the world that I thought that it could use.  If I ever felt that it wouldn't benefit people I would have given up. <strong> It's never been about me</strong>.</p>
<p>That being said, I'm trying to figure out what's next that's in Hollrback's best interest.  In no scenario would folding it benefit anyone.  Remember when I asked if there was currently a better solution than it, and I answered no?  If there was, then I'd let them do it and I'd be a happy user of their service.  But even the people with millions of dollars behind them (and have copied some Hollrback functionality, I'm honored) can't make things take off.  To me that's called an even playing field.</p>
<p>So I'm looking at options.  I think the incubator/business accelerator model is perfect for me.  I want to be surrounded by people who have done it before.  But Omaha doesn't currently have anything and the "big ones" out there care a lot about you having an awesome team, and I have no team.  It's just me.</p>
<p>So that's that.</p>
<p>I thought about disabling comments to this post, since I assume the responses will be over simplified (everybody seems to know what's best when they're not involved), but go ahead.  Tell me what you would do if you were me.  Keep in mind this isn't a product issue ("U SHULD ADD BADGES AND INSTAGRAM SUPPORT"), but a larger issue regarding myself and my attempt to give something to to the world.  If you know someone that might be interested in talking with me, go ahead and share this post with them, I'd love to chat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Gabe - I love that you are being so open.
My feeling is fundamentally different than yours.</p>
<p>Don't build something for YOU first.  That is the 37 Signals model but that doesn't work if you don't have a biz already that needs biz process software.</p>
<p>You must solve real pain points/problems with your product first and foremostly in a customer segment that is large enough and can afford your offering and which you can produce for less than the customer pays you to own it... that's all business is.</p>
<p>I'm not dogging your approach but what you've described is creating a product/square peg and then trying to find a customer set to fill with that square peg... what if the customer needs a round peg?</p>
<p>Don't build something not knowing if anyone even needs it.</p>
<p>Building stuff for YOU means nothing - what if you are the ONLY one that wants it?  then you have a market of one (or even 100) that's just not enough.</p>
<p>Build to solve a real problem - do research on why the problem exists - test assumptions about the customer and their buying habits - test it some more - talk to 100 possible customers - then build a MVP and watch 15 possible customers use the raw/shitty version of what you hope to build out later.  </p>
<p>++ Then 100 + steps after that must be executed too but the above is a start.</p>
<p>That's "my opinion" on the Steps 1 through 5+</p>
<p>But what do I know?</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>First of all, huge props to you for sharing a story about failure. The Midwest is so very averse to failure, and we need more people brave enough to share so that everyone can get used to talking about it, learning from it, and mitigating our fears.
For what it's worth, I consider your need to make ends meet with a job and the Hollrback project to be somewhat orthogonal concerns.</p>
<p>Revenue is the ultimate goal of a business, of course, but I just don't think it's realistic for people to expect you to immediately pull down a living wage from a free-to-use app business model.</p>
<p>Plus, didn't you write that it had become a team effort, anyway?</p>
<p>Think of all you have learned and done, and how scary and impossible it would have seemed to the dude in the cube at West! I hope to hear some more stories about your lessons learned, SXSW, TechStars, etc from you sometime.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Lateef,That's a great, succinct post you linked to.  I've never seen that "Startup Pyramid" before, and I really agree with it.  I'll keep that one around.</p>
<p>I know it's just me, and maybe it's a huge fault of mine, but I care way more about creating value than executing a revenue model.  I find it to be premature to ask for money before you've actually made someone's life better with what you offered them.  Hollrback absolutely has a plan, in writing, to monetize.  But it's yet to reach that place.  For Hollrback, and any consumer service, the problem is traction.  It's a really, really hard problem to get around, and I know now you need someone knowledgable to work with you on it.  In this case a failed (uninformed, over-optimistic, too broad) go to market strategy is responsible for that.  Getting one paid user only means that user will be disappointed.  It's not like a service company where the first customer makes you profitable and you can survive off of that reoccurring revenue from a handful of clients you hand acquired.</p>
<p>A lack of revenue from a successful product is a problem I'd be happy to tackle.  But seeing Hollrback's failures as this is certainly not something I align with.</p>
<p>Again, it's just my opinion.
Step 1) Build something you want.
Step 2) Find out if others want this too.
Step 3) Give it to them.
Step 4) See how they use it, find what it's worth to them.
Step 5) Charge for it.</p>
<p>Hollrback never got farther than a few feet off the step 4 starting line.  Obviously that go to market strategy would be different in retrospect, but I'm not smart enough to know how.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Maybe it's because you've surrounded yourself with or only sought out advice or feedback from people who aren't straight up with you. Hollrback is a great idea, but the execution (at least on the Android platform) was poor. It was unresponsive on Sprint's HTC EVO 4G, kinda confusing at first w/ many steps to create your first card and connection, and it was actually broken when I pulled it up and tried to use it in a group of peers for the first and second time. I tweeted you directly about it but received no response, so I forgot about it and stopped using it. To be fair, I haven't used it on the iPhone.
Also, I hardly think you "failed" anything or anybody by getting a paying gig. This must have been hard to post considering how you obviously feel about it, but I'm impressed you had the courage to actually say something about it in such a public way. You obviously feel strongly about it, which is why I feel that I owe it to you to be honest and tell you the truth about how I and at least a few others really feel about it.</p>
<p>It's not all bad, though. This is exactly the type of thing that can make a mediocre product better, maybe even GREAT if given enough of a chance. Honest feedback is something you need, and Omaha (in certain circles) doesn't really excel at that. It's too busy giving high fives and slaps on the back to get around to that. So really, if you think about it, maybe it isn't you who failed Omaha, so much as Omaha failed you.</p>
<p>Cheer up, keep at it even if it's the nights and weekends. Listen to and solicit honest feedback, be patient, and I believe you'll get the results and success you're hoping for.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Gabe, thanks for sharing.
Having been part of a startup that failed leaving a HUGE crater, I can feel for you.  I agree with many above that it doesn't have to be over.  Like Miles said above, a day job doesn't mean your not an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>There is a notion in startup circles that if you don't quit your day job, then you are not committed.  Bulls**t.  Reality is that you need a place to live and food to eat.  It's the whole Maslow hierarchy of needs thing.  In my case there is 4 other human beings that depend on my pay check for their well being.  Not something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>I've had VC's tell me that they will only invest in "committed entrepreneurs" which is code for quitting your day job.  I guess my view of that is working 2 full time jobs shows a tremendous commitment.  Our plan is to get to full time within the next year, but you can't focus on building a great business if you are worried about being thrown out of your house.  Burdening a fledgling business with salaries before it can support them is not a smart business move.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is keep working on Hollrback on the side and find yourself a good co-founder.  Good luck!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I don't think you are a failure until you give up completely. So you have to get a job to pay rent, so what?
Fuck that person who said Hollrback is just a side project and not a company. Perhaps you need to set different expectations now that you have a day job but I think you should still move forward with Hollrback.</p>
<p>It's taken me well over a year to write my novel because I'm a single mom, I work full time, I was going to school full time and I run Slacker Heroes. That doesn't mean I'm a failure. It just means that I have a full life and don't have the luxury of sitting at my keyboard all day.</p>
<p>Good luck to you and let me know if I can help in any way.</p>

You also can't compare valley companies to Omaha companies.  In the valley you can take in a couple million dollars, dedicate yourself to having a team experiment for a couple years and figure out what works.  A very different scenario.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

Sharing that had to be a big challenge, but I think you can safely say there is support for you and your endeavors. Just keep the faith and don't give up. Your example will inspire the vision of generations of entrepreneurs to-come. Think about that... You're in a fantastic position RIGHT NOW.
Keep your head up. You can do it.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Aron:You're so right about the Android client.  In retrospect Android should have been completely held off and let iPhone alone be the launch platform since that's the hardware I use.  That's the approach that other services take and that works.</p>
<p>From one phone to the next the Android client operated differently and due to everything outlined above and the single Android device I have not being able to replicate the issues that you, and others (different issues) have it never became a priority to work on something I couldn't even troubleshoot.  I'm sorry if I seemed unresponsive about it.</p>
<p>But honestly, on the iPhone (and for many Android users), people have really liked it and functionality/performance feedback was positive.  Even outside of the Omaha bubble.  It's why I traveled to gain feedback.  I'm conscious of what Omaha is, as I think everyone should be.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I'm not saying to build out an entire company and then find out if anyone is interested in what you have to offer.  But sometimes you have to take a few steps forward and build something before you can find out if anyone really gets it.  I felt this way with Hollrback.  If you were to ask people what the solution to having only a single business card for a single context would be, they'd say to print different business cards.  If you were to ask them about the organization and management of them, they'd say a better business card scanner.
There's the old Henry Ford quote saying when he asked his customers what they wanted they told him a "faster horse".</p>
<p>To innovate is to take risks.  It's also a way to waste a lot of money and end up with a worthless company.  But I'm just not interested in working on a problem that I'm not personally interested in solving.  I understand that's a drawback.</p>
<p>If I wanted an easy round peg in round hole problem I'd write accounting software.  Everyone hates their accounting software.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Gabe,
Great post - Omaha needs more discussion like this and more people like you. </p>
<p>I definitely see how you're feeling - you explain your feelings well - but I'm a little confused about the why. Why exactly do you feel like a failure? Because you had to get a job to pay the rent? Because Hollrback hasn't reached the number of users you were hoping?</p>
<p>How long have you been working on Hollrback? I've read several things from successful entrepreneurs that say it takes at least three years to give something a shot. And I don't think three years really includes the initial development time. I think three years covers feedback, iterations, and marketing. The first time I heard of Hollrback was about a year ago and I think you had just launched. So basically I'm trying to say, have you really given this enough time to consider it a failure yet?</p>
<p>Also, I agree with Aron in saying that Omaha failed you. I think it's an utter disgrace that with all of the talented business people we supposedly have here, an incredibly talented and technical person like yourself couldn't get adequate support from even one business person to really help you with marketing and revenue. That says a ton about the state of Omaha right now in my opinion. So my advice to you is to try to find a marketing/business person (I know I know - but now I think you're learning their value first hand) willing and able to make your company their main focus, and let them do their thing, with your guidance of course. </p>
<p>Also, I know you didn't really want product recommendations, but I just wanted to say that for me one of the biggest barriers to me using Hollrback is that the signup process is cumbersome. Not very many people use it when I meet them so it's hard for me to use it, but if there was a simple way to set up your contact info on your phone and be ready to share it in seconds, withou making an account and setting a password - I could show people how to do it when I meet them somewhere and we could trade info in under thirty seconds. Right now it's one of those things I tell people they should use, they look at it, say I'll do this later, put their phone away, and then forget about it. </p>
<p>You rock Gabe - don't give up!!!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>There's a lot of good discussion here so I'll just say this - YOU are not a fuckup or a failure. Whether Hollrback takes on new life from here or not, you did something 99.9% of people never do - go all in and risk everything on something you're passionate about. If you hadn't, you probably would have always wondered 'what if.' And when you needed to cut your losses to survive, you did. When you needed to recognize your own strengths and look for help to fill in the gaps, you did that too. And through all that, you were and still are driven by the product and the users, not the paycheck.
When I all that up, I see a pretty awesome, honest, humble human being. Failure sucks, but you yourself are not a failure, and I think the fact that you're willing to write this post and reach out just emphasizes that. Hang in there, and don't write yourself off.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Self awareness is a cruel bitch, but it's a necessary precursor to success. It's definitely something I struggled with on Tournology. I don't know that I've even had the courage to admit failure on it, and the site has been down for over a year now. Honesty with yourself is clearly one of your strong suits. Keep your wits about you and your chin up. The worst outcome from this is to think that you are a failure. Let me know if I can help.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Sounds like you're ambivalent about advice, but here it goes.  For a consumer app, measure demand in this way:  (http://startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/), then iterate to improve that objective measure.  I think the revenue model is a big, gaping question, but I'm sure you have thoughts about that.
BTW, I was *exactly* where you're at about a year ago.  You're right.  It's embarrassing.  However, not as embarrassing as failing to learn from your experience.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Gabe,
I totally feel you on that.  Youre out in Omaha and Im out here in Hawaii of all places developing something that I hope the world will want too.  It's a tough and risky  business.   Plus,  No one likes to fail.  In my opinion you should do what you are passionate about though.  Just a thought but Gabe have you ever tried finding talent overseas and hiring good talent for less?  You might be able to put together  a team at a low cost.   Ive been in the insurance industry for 4 years and thats what I use to fund my projects =)    Anyhow, I wish you the best of luck Gabe!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Another adventure begins.  Goodbye Omaha.</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/01/goodbye-omaha</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My time in Omaha is coming to an end.  On Friday, February 3rd I'll have relocated to San Francisco.
When looking back at the past three years it's hard to decide what to put in this rather long retrospective post.  But I'll use it as my last opportunity to highlight, clarify, give thanks, and try to explain why I'm taking on this new adventure.</p>
<p>I moved to Omaha thinking I'd have to dodge cows on the way to the office every day.  I thought I'd really dislike the city, but the job I moved here for would make it worth it.  Many of you know how quickly I discovered the opposite.  <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/05/six-months-of-being-an-omahan-bigomaha">I fell in love with Omaha, its people and vowed to leave my job within a year</a>.</p>
<p>Being around the Omaha community <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/11/choices-decisions-and-fear-part-2">I learned, for the first time, about taking risks</a>, <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/09/the-freedom-of-choice-but-the-fear-of-making-the-wrong-ones">trying something new</a>, and that putting your all into something wasn't just something for the "other guys", it's something everyone should do.  <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/04/next-step">I knew quickly I needed something more than "a job".</a>  I also learned of the support system sometimes needed in order for you to take those risks.  Omaha provided that for me.</p>
<p><a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2009/05/my-big-post-on-bigomaha">I attended the first Big Omaha</a> <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a060/1355981319647/?format=original">and  left with an idea</a>.  Something I wanted to build because I wanted to use it myself.  <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2010/04/i-was-asked-what-ive-been-doing-so-here-you-go">The idea of Hollrback was born</a>.  With the help of my friend Kat I compiled a video to try and drum up some support for the project.  Before long project "Mysterious Dottie" was in full swing.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/5593159?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;autoplay=0" frameborder="0" width="403" height="272"></iframe></p>
<p>Through the experience of Hollrback, among many other things, I started to learn the city that I previously decided I'd be more than happy to live in for the rest of my life may not be for me after all, at least in the short term.  I started to feel like personally I was missing out on something.  Something I've been needing to learn, not even knowing what it is.</p>
<p>On top of that I've been slowly finding that my idea of the startup culture that I wanted to experience was something different than what was aimed for in the Prairie.  I wanted endless incubators, .com veterans, mentors and people willing to invest (not just financially, but that too) into the people here.  It made me realize instead of continuing my never-ending stream of regional constructive criticism, trying to turn it into what I want it to be, instead I should just go.</p>
<p>This isn't easy, though.  I feel like I'm giving up on Omaha.  I care a lot about this place, the people.  I know many are probably thinking by this point "just go already and shut the hell up", but I've always only wanted the best for everyone.  I wasn't always happy with just warm fuzzies and people giving each other high fives and pats on the back.  To me it's not about how many people can think nice things about other people.  To me it's about execution. <a href="/gabes-digital-life-1/2011/10/embarrassment-is-embarrassing"> I've failed with my first attempt at execution, but damnit I tried</a>.  I've wanted Omaha to be full of people building awesome stuff to fulfill whatever vision they have.  But it's a very service-oriented city.  Consulting firms, financial services, branding agencies, development houses.  I'm not interested in doing work for people.  I want to build stuff to put into real people's hands.  The public.  Not ten people in an office somewhere to help them turn $1million into $2million.</p>
<p>But I never would have known this about myself if it weren't for Omaha giving me the opportunity to learn it first hand.  Seeing the DownsDesigns, the What Cheers, the Princess Lasertrons, the Rahul Guptas, the Secret Penguins branch off from whatever they did before and start doing their own thing under their own rules.  Showing me that "having a job" is never the goal, and it's about doing something awesome that you care about.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be moving on if it weren't for Silicon Prairie News highlighting others and giving me something to aspire to.  For highlighting little things I do, even when I tell them it's dumb.  (The post they wrote about my Chrome Plugin was the <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2011/12/the-10-most-read-posts-of-2011-i-d-pay-zaarly-to-hire-me-tops-list">2nd most read story on SPN last year</a>, after I told Danny it was stupid and a waste of his time.  He did it anyway.  I was wrong.)  For creating Big Omaha and letting that inspire me to try something for myself.  Danny, Jeff and Dusty are probably sick of listening to me after three years, but I've never had anything but the upmost respect and admiration for what they're doing.  For reference: <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/tags/gabe-kangas">Here's the full catalog of things they felt worthy of discussing when it came to me</a>.</p>
<p>As an example of SPN picking up on the goofy things I do in the early days, here's the first interview they ever did with me to discuss "Retweet Thursday".  News was slow back then.</p>
<p><iframe id="viddler-f8e3eb60" src="//www.viddler.com/embed/f8e3eb60/?f=1&amp;offset=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;disablebranding=0" frameborder="0" width="545" height="349"></iframe></p>
<p>Going forward I just hope something I did here in my short time has made some kind of impact. I always tried to be the best representative of the city of Omaha as I could be when going out to meet the rest of the world.  I always told them how if you need to go somewhere, and you don't know where to go, put Omaha first on your list.  This place can give you clarity that you didn't even know you needed.</p>
<p>I'm not one for heady advice one liners, but I can leave with you the one thing I told myself when given this opportunity to pick up from my Omaha life and build a new one:  Live the life you'd be jealous of.  So that's what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Come visit some  me time.  I can't promise I'll have room in my apartment, though.  Housing is a little tight out there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You have done so much here in Omaha and you have quite the story to tell.  Heading to the Coast; your story will only get more interesting.  Keep us all clued in to whats going on so we (I) can continue to live vicariously though you.  I can't wait to visit!</p>

      <title>I've lived in San Francisco for a while</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/07/ive-lived-in-san-francisco-for-a-while</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was asked a few weeks back why I haven't written a post on my blog since I've been to San Francisco. I mean, there must be a lot of stuff to talk about, right? It's a pretty significant move and maybe the world wants to hear me blab about it. But I think in general I have been blabbing about it, but in more specific channels.  But that's not to say I shouldn't have a larger periodic update.  And I'd probably miss a ton, so I'm going to do the generalizing thing instead of trying to think of every neat thing specifically.  Ok, I'll throw some specifics in too.
San Francisco is like a custom-made little city that was built just for me.  The fact that I'm sure a lot of people feel that way speaks to the variety and life that this little big city brings.  I remember the first time I went to the Cat Club and the DJ played Prodigy's "Spitfire".  I looked to my friend and said "I don't remember the last time I heard The Prodigy played publicly."  It's one of those tiny moments that bring things into perspective and made me glad I was here.</p>
<p>Obviously I love music, and this city is great for the music that I enjoy.  Just like Omaha is a great city for people who enjoy acoustic guitars and singer-songwriters, San Francisco is great for people who enjoy synthesizers, and electronic drums.  Other things too.  I just happen to like things I can dance to.  I can go out multiple times a week and dance all night to VNV Nation, Apoptygma Berzerk, and Nine Inch Nails from a DJ; surrounded by other people who enjoy it as much as I do.  It's a city where all the artists that I enjoy come through, and I really have to pay attention to the concert calendar so I don't miss something.  There's so much.</p>
<p>One time at pride after getting backstage at a DJ VIP area I danced on stage in front of all of these people (below). <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a063/1355981319678/?format=original"><img title="pride" height="225" alt="" width="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-36822" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a066/1355981319691/?format=original" /></a></p>
<p>The people here are an interesting breed.  In general they're all young, all good looking, and all full of energy.  They don't get married young, and they don't have children.  My kind of people.  It's easier to meet friends because there are just more people able to go out without finding baby sitters.  There's an overarching trend of people being "outdoorsy" here.  Like hiking, or camping, or white water rafting or whatever.  This puzzled me when I first moved here.  How is everyone doing this crap?  I don't even walk on a single blade of grass in a day (100% true), so where are they setting up a tent?  It doesn't snow, where are they skiing?  But it seems that SF is close enough to all of these places.  And while I do believe people do enjoy it, I think people make a bigger deal out of it just to fit in, since everybody else climbs mountains, there's pressure for you to enjoy that too.  FYI: I don't climb mountains.  But outside of the people who obviously try and fit in, people here are awesome.  They're crazy.  They lack in inhibitions.  They do what makes them happy.  It took me zero time to feel at home here.  These are my people.</p>
<p>One time Andy Peters (@andypeters) came for WWDC and I dragged him to Bondage-a-go-go, my weekly dance club night.  It was totally rad to be able to bring one of my good Omaha friends out with me in San Francisco.  He had a blast.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a069/1355981319703/?format=original"><img title="Gabe and Andy" height="300" alt="" width="225" class="size-medium wp-image-36823 aligncenter" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a06c/1355981319715/?format=original" /></a></p>
<p>I expected when I came here to throw myself head-first into the startup culture.  I mean, this is the center of the technology world.  But that hasn't been the case.  I think it's simply because I'm enjoying myself at my current position and I'm not looking to throw myself into something else right now.  I'm making video games, and it's brand new to me.  Something new is always a ton more fun, so I'm enjoying it immensely.  My company is great, and I enjoy everybody who works there.  I tell people it's like going to summer camp every day.  You work on projects together with peers, but in this case we make money off of our projects, and still have fun.  Though I know myself well enough that somewhere down the road I will be looking for "what's next?", and I couldn't be in a better place to find out.  But I know I need to get out there and start meeting people to make that happen.  It's just hard when you work late nights in Burlingame, ya' know?</p>
<p>Speaking of work, one time I launched a video game with an awesome team called <a title="Fish With Attitude" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fish-with-attitude/id509854030?mt=8">Fish With Attitude</a>.  It's a pretty fun game, if I do say so myself.  It's being rated very highly, it's ranked in the Top 10 of the Apple App Store, and the players love it.  In fact, we received a marriage proposal from someone who enjoyed the game so much the other day.  Crazy.  Here's everyone that's ever been involved with it at a bar.  And a random review someone did of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a06f/1355981319729/?format=original"><img title="Team Fish with Attitude" height="223" alt="" width="300" class="size-medium wp-image-36825 aligncenter" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a072/1355981319742/?format=original" /></a></p>
<p>Did you know there's a place where you can order almost any kind of food, completely online, at almost any hour of the day?  That place is San Francisco, and they realize sometimes you just need a calzone at 3am.  Seriously, you don't even have to call them.  Order from your iPhone if you want!  This fact cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>So that's that for now.  Rock on.</p>

      <title>Respect for gender goes both ways. A rant from a modern male.</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/09/rant-from-a-modern-male</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'll probably upset a lot of people because this is something that people just don't talk about, and would be seen as weak if said out loud.  But here it is:
I'm sick of the male stereotype.</p>
<p>You know how "woman, get in the kitchen!" is a totally not ok thing to say?  For so many reasons, not just because it's demeaning, and it attempts to put someone in their place, but also as a person... maybe they don't like making sandwiches.  Just because they were born a female has nothing to do with their ability, interest, or responsibility to make you a sandwich.  So why is it completely ok to expect males to be the stereotype of "masculinity", and see something wrong with them if they're not?</p>
<p><a href="http://unwinona.tumblr.com/post/30861660109/i-debated-whether-or-not-to-share-this-story">This post was shared around the internet a lot today.</a>  A terrifying story of a young woman verbally assaulted on a train.  But in her sad story of how she's repeatedly disrespected due to her gender she unapologetically stereotypes a "real man" simply as someone willing to get violent on her behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a075/1355981319765/?format=original"><img title="A real man" height="194" alt="" width="647" class="aligncenter  wp-image-38807" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a075/1355981319765/?format=original" /></a></p>
<p>Encouraging violence is not ok.  It continues the eternal stereotype of "real men" as those who are inherently violent at their core.</p>
<p>If it were me, violence would be the last thing on my mind.  If I saw a woman being harassed I'd ask the person to stop.  I'd call the police.  I'd do any number of things.  The first thought in my mind would not be to tell the woman "if they come back I'll beat them up for you."  What kind of reaction is that?  Why do women find that comforting and not terrifying?</p>
<p>This is just one example.  It's commonly accepted that I should know how to fix cars.  I should enjoy going to and participating in sporting events.  "What are you, gay or something?" I get asked if I turn down a girl's advances.  A girl who sleeps with every guy is seen as a slut, but a guy who does it is expected.  If he doesn't, there's something wrong with him.</p>
<p>"Man, get in the garage!" is an attempt to put a male in his place just like the sandwich making.  Both use gender stereotypes to determine their role in the eyes of another person.</p>
<p>Girls, welcome to 2012.  Where guys like me enjoy going to see musical theatre, sing along to Ace of Base, don't know anything about cars, and would much rather hit up a museum than a sporting event.  You don't have to like it, but know there are a lot of us.  And if your idea of a "real man" is someone who will simply kick someone else's ass, then you're not the type of girl we want around us anyway.</p>
<p>Guys, welcome to 2012.  Where guys no longer harass women on trains and you treat them as you'd want to be treated.  With respect.</p>

      <title>Gabe's 2012 Year in Review</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/2012-year-in-review</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's time for my mostly-annual "stuff and things" post. &nbsp;I've missed some years, but I think I have more new stuff this time around. &nbsp;I'll try and detail all of the software, hardware and services that I've used this year to make my personal and professional life better or more interesting.<br></p><h1>Software<br></h1><h3>Desktop (OS X)</h3><ul><li><strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" data-link-type="external">Xcode</a></strong>.<br>Love it or hate it, I live in it. &nbsp;Actually, I don't know if I love it or hate it.</li><li><strong><a href="http://panic.com/transmit/" data-link-type="external">Transmit</a></strong>.<br>For many years in a row it's been my OS X FTP client of choice and I'm still very happy with it.</li><li><strong><a href="http://www.codeux.com/textual/" data-link-type="external">Textual</a></strong>.<br>I switched OS X IRC clients this year to to Textual. &nbsp;It's open source, and it's pretty customizable. &nbsp;It's done me well, while admittedly my requirements in a desktop IRC client are minimal these days. &nbsp;Not like the crazy stuff I used to do back in the "good ol' days". &nbsp;This app doesn't seem to be actively updated on the App Store, but it's open source so I just compile it myself.</li><li><strong><a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/" data-link-type="external">Tweetbot</a></strong>.<br>The Tapbots guys can do no wrong, and I was happy to pay anything they wanted when I found they were coming out with a desktop version of Tweetbot. &nbsp;</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" data-link-type="external">Chrome</a>. &nbsp;<br></strong>It has been my browser of choice. &nbsp;I don't know why. &nbsp;I guess it's faster? &nbsp;I'm pretty browser agnostic, in general. &nbsp;As long as you can build plugins for it and it's fast I'm fine.</li><li><strong><a href="http://macromates.com/" data-link-type="external">Textmate</a> / <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" data-link-type="external">Sublime Text 2</a></strong>.<br>I've been using the same old version of Textmate for years. &nbsp;But I'm trying to move over to Sublime Text 2. &nbsp;Sometimes I forget. &nbsp;But Sublime Text 2 is better, &nbsp;the features are handy, and it's faster.<br></li><li><strong><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword" data-link-type="external">1Password</a>.</strong><br>A great password management application for desktop and mobile, 1Password makes my life easy by managing all of the many developer accounts I have, as well as the ever growing social media world.</li></ul><h3 style="letter-spacing: normal;">Mobile (iOS)</h3><ol></ol>

<ul><li><strong><a href="#" data-link-type="external">Tweetbot</a></strong>.<br>Same as above. &nbsp;But for iOS.</li><li><strong><a href="http://www.sfclimates.com/" data-link-type="external">SF Climates</a>.</strong><br>A weather application for the many micro-climates of San Francisco. &nbsp;Everyone in SF should have this because it works. &nbsp;Nobody outside of the city limits has a use for it.</li><li><strong><a href="http://reederapp.com/" data-link-type="external">Reeder</a></strong>.<br>I don't use this because I love it, I use it because it currently works for me. &nbsp;I require a RSS reader that will cache posts offline so I can read them while on BART. &nbsp;This does that. &nbsp;I'm always keeping my eyes out for something better.</li><li><strong><a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/" data-link-type="external">Downcast</a></strong>.<br>After moving to SF I started listening to Podcasts again. &nbsp;When in Omaha I stopped listening all together, mostly due to a lack of a commute. &nbsp;Here I'm listening to them just as much as I was in Chicago, and I'm again hooked. &nbsp;Downcast is a really great podcast consumption application. &nbsp;It has everything that I could want. &nbsp;Things like playback speed, dynamic playlists and geo-fencing makes this the application for people who take podcasts seriously.</li><li><strong><a href="http://highlig.ht/" data-link-type="external">Highlight</a></strong>.<br>As a fan of social-by-way-of-digital having an application that just tells me who's around is interesting to me. &nbsp;I can ping those people that seem interesting, and you never know what will come of that.</li><li><strong><a href="http://www.workclub.net/" data-link-type="external">Workclub</a></strong>.<br>This is a new application from the Coffee &amp; Power people. &nbsp;It's something that I don't exactly know the true value of yet, but I think will become&nbsp;apparent&nbsp;before long. &nbsp;As people are checking into their respective locations, it's cool to know what people are working on, and where. &nbsp;I think this information can be invaluable at some point in the future when you realize "Hey, I think I saw a guy working on X at Y. &nbsp;I should get in touch with him". &nbsp;I almost want to think of it as virtual coworking. &nbsp;I look forward to see what it does in the next year.</li><li><strong><a href="http://www.routesy.com/" data-link-type="external">Routsey Pro</a></strong>.<br>It tells me the when's and where's of the public transportation system of the Bay Area. &nbsp;I set bookmarks of the stops and routes that I rely on and it becomes a one stop view of how much time until another one goes by.<br></li><li><strong><a href="http://lyft.me/" data-link-type="external">Lyft</a> / <a href="https://www.uber.com/" data-link-type="external">Uber</a>.<br></strong>Lyft is my first choice for having a car pick me up and bring me somewhere, &nbsp;it's cheaper than Uber. &nbsp;But sometimes demand isn't in my favor and I go back to Uber. &nbsp;Both are awesome services when using their application will tell someone behind a wheel where to get me. &nbsp;And best part: no paying with cash.</li></ul>

<h1>Services</h1><ul><li><strong><a href="http://www.spotify.com" data-link-type="external">Spotify</a></strong>.<br>I was a Spotify user years ago. &nbsp;I had a fake UK account and I used a UK proxy server to access it. &nbsp;Eventually they shut me down and I no longer had access to the service. &nbsp;When Rdio launched I became a happy subscriber and used that until Spotify came to the US. &nbsp;After comparing and contrasting side-by-side I again went back to Spotify mostly due to the API.</li></ul><p></p><ul><li><strong><a href="http://www.evernote.com" data-link-type="external">Evernote</a></strong>.<br>I'm not sure why I pay for Evernote. &nbsp;I should stop. &nbsp;I use it plenty, but not enough to require the paid plan. &nbsp;It's my cloud-based dropbox of text that I always know is accessible everywhere. &nbsp;I use it for everything from todo lists, to just sketching down notes.<br></li><li><strong><a href="http://getcloudapp.com/" data-link-type="external">Cloud.ly</a></strong>.<br>Such a rad service. &nbsp;I have a little menu item that sits there waiting for me to drag something on it, and when I do it uploads it and copies the URL to my clipboard. &nbsp;As simple as that. &nbsp;It'll also auto-upload screenshots. &nbsp;It works great and I use it a ton every day for sending files around to people.<br></li><li><strong><a href="http://www.hover.com" data-link-type="external">Hover</a></strong>.<br>My domain registrar of choice. &nbsp;It used to be the old "Tucows Domains" from the day, but rebranded. &nbsp;It's a simple, clean service. &nbsp;If you think about what the complete opposite of GoDaddy would be, it would be Hover.<br></li><li><strong><a href="http://www.fastmail.fm" data-link-type="external">Fastmail</a></strong>.<br>I continue to use Fastmail.fm as my email provider. &nbsp;I pay them every year to do nothing but accept email and make it accessible to me. &nbsp;They're not going through my email and selling the data to the highest bidder, and aren't trying to make me into a webmail convert.<br></li><li><strong><a href="http://www.dropbox.com" data-link-type="external">Dropbox</a></strong>.<br>Dropbox is kind of like the working directory of my life. &nbsp;All documents, code, images, etc hang out here. &nbsp;It's nice to know all my stuff is accessible from anywhere I happen to be. &nbsp;Throw something in there and then grab it again from my iPhone or at work.<br></li><li><strong><a href="https://testflightapp.com" data-link-type="external">Testflight</a></strong>.<br>TestFlight makes the life of any iPhone developer easier. &nbsp;I use it both personally and professionally to send out test versions of applications I'm working on. &nbsp;Without it the test process for normal users is a little more convoluted than you'd like, but using Testflight it's fast and easy. &nbsp;Plus they add things like bug reporting, checkpoints and install reporting. &nbsp;For free.<br><br></li></ul><h1>Hardware</h1><ul><li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" data-link-type="external">iPhone 5</a></strong>.<br>The upgrade from the iPhone4S to the iPhone5 was one of the bigger ones. &nbsp;It's&nbsp;substantially&nbsp;faster and the screen is a great size. &nbsp;The memory bump in it makes a huge difference as well, as apps that are "in the background" take a lot longer to get killed by the OS. &nbsp;Something I launch before work now is still alive when I go home.</li><li><a href="http://www.klipsch.com/image-one-on-ear-headset" data-link-type="external"></a><strong><a href="http://www.klipsch.com/image-one-on-ear-headset" data-link-type="external">Klipsch Image ONE</a> </strong>headphones.<br>The pair of headphones I've had for years, and really liked, a set of Sennheisers, finally reached their end this year so it was time to find a new pair. &nbsp;I figured I'd use the Apple Store as my venue of choice to try out different options, since they had them physically there and it was easy to return if needed. &nbsp;I tried a couple different ones and returned them. &nbsp;I even thought I'd give a brand I wouldn't normally try, Skull Candy, a shot. &nbsp;For your future reference the "Aviators" were awful. &nbsp;Just awful. &nbsp;More proof that headphones associated with a rapper (Jay-Z in this case) are bad. &nbsp;Anyway. &nbsp;I really like this pair of Klipschs. &nbsp;They are over the ear, light, and mobile. &nbsp;Perfect for my commuting and listening at work needs.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/" data-link-type="external"><strong>AppleTV</strong></a>.<br>Next to my iPhone my AppleTV is the piece of hardware I use the most. &nbsp;I purchase current shows through iTunes. &nbsp;I stream movies through Netflix. &nbsp;New movies I rent through iTunes. &nbsp;If I wanted to use Hulu, that's there as well. &nbsp;I've amassed a digital library of episodes of my favorite shows I can watch at any time, and I often do. &nbsp;It's also a great AirTunes receiver where I send it music from Spotify from my Macbook Pro, iPhone or iPad to fill my apartment with tunes. &nbsp;This piece of hardware is the most underrated Apple product, and I'm a fan.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h1></h1><h1>Misc</h1><ul><li><strong><a href="http://www.1800gotjunk.com/" data-link-type="external">1-800-Got-Junk</a></strong>.<br>When I moved from Omaha to SF I had a ton of stuff I didn't know what to do with. &nbsp;I hate selling things, so I figured I'd offer everything I had to friends, and anything left would just get disposed of. &nbsp;1-800-Junk to the rescue. &nbsp;They showed up with a truck and took everything I pointed out into their truck, and then charged me less than I expected to pay.</li></ul><h1>Media/Music and Podcasts</h1><ul><li>These are the podcasts I'm currently subscribed to:</li></ul><ol><li><a href="http://twit.tv/tnt" data-link-type="external">Tech News Today</a>. &nbsp;A daily podcast detailing a succinct dose of what you need to know in the world of technology.</li><li><a href="http://twit.tv/mbw" data-link-type="external">MacBreak Weekly</a>. &nbsp;A weekly podcast discussing the world of Apple products.</li><li><a href="http://twit.tv/twit" data-link-type="external">this WEEK in TECH</a>. &nbsp;A weekly podcast discussing everything that happened in tech in detail.</li><li><a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com/" data-link-type="external">You Look Nice Today</a>. &nbsp;A comedy-ish podcast that is just three funny guys chatting. &nbsp;From the mind of Merlin Mann.</li><li><a href="http://www.maccast.com/" data-link-type="external">MacCast</a>. &nbsp;A weekly podcast about the world of Apple products.</li><li><a href="http://www.imore.com/category/debug" data-link-type="external">Debug</a>. &nbsp;A new podcast that focuses on the world of iPhone development. &nbsp;Great guests/interviews and really goes in depth with some of the great applications that live in the Apple ecosystem.</li></ol>

<ul><li>As far as the musical soundtrack of 2012, I can't say there's a ton of really new stuff that I listened to. &nbsp;A lot of stuff that's just "new to me". &nbsp;I can say the new Blaqk Audio album was way rad, and I listened to that a ton. &nbsp;Also the first full length album from Stepdad was something I recommended to people. &nbsp;Marilyn Manson came back with a&nbsp;vengeance&nbsp;with the new album "Born&nbsp;Villain&nbsp;, I enjoyed that quite a bit. &nbsp;And last, but not least, Mark Mallman's epic adventure "Double Silhouette" is a masterpiece. &nbsp;My favorite Mallman album, and that's saying a lot. &nbsp;I feel like he's taken the songwriting and construction of these songs in a new direction that I really like. &nbsp;That on top of the obvious attention to detail of the production quality makes it a must listen.<br>Anyway, here's a list of songs I've listened to a lot in the past year with the help of Last.FM keeping track of that for me.</li></ul><p></p><p></p>

<p>I'm not a fan of New Years resolutions, but there are some things I'd like to do in this next year. &nbsp;All very doable things, but if you think that in any way you'd be able to help with any of them I'd certainly be up for pointers!</p><ol><li>Contribute to an open source project that focuses on a) mobile and b) something I care about. &nbsp;(<strong>Note</strong>: I checked out the Colloquy source last night and started looking at their bug list to see if I could help with anything).</li><li>Find musical performance opportunities. &nbsp;Particularly I'd like to find a way to drum. Obviously I can't have a drum set in my apartment for a number of reasons, but there must be some kind of drumset co-op or open-drum night somewhere?</li><li>Write an Android application. &nbsp;At the moment my plan is to finish #TheCabin Mobile 2.0 for iOS and then port it to Android.</li><li>Find a way to be a part of the tech community here. &nbsp;It's been near impossible working in Burlingame long hours to make events in SF that I really want to be able to get to. &nbsp;I'm missing out. &nbsp;Maybe also find a coworking location that is open nights and weekends that I can hang out at.</li></ol><p>All accomplishable things that really have nothing to do with the new year, just things I've been wanting to do and now is as good of a time as any to write them down!</p><p>Happy New Year, friends.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My thoughts and experiences on the Pebble Smart Watch</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/2/my-thoughts-and-experiences-on-the-pebble-smart-watch</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LIke with a lot of things in life I told myself I didn't want one. &nbsp;And then when it came down to it I realized I was lying to myself and I actually did.</p><p>This was the story behind the Pebble Smart Watch. &nbsp;Once people started getting them delivered, and I read <a href="http://danilocampos.com/2013/02/five-days-with-pebble/">this review</a> I knew I must have it. &nbsp;Luckily Criagslist exists and people were selling theirs. &nbsp;Watch acquired.</p><p>@franktronic asked if I could write a mini-review of my experience thus far with the little gizmo. &nbsp;I figured why not. &nbsp;But you should also read the awesome <a href="http://danilocampos.com/2013/02/five-days-with-pebble/">Five days with Pebble by Danilo Campos</a>&nbsp;as he's much more&nbsp;eloquent&nbsp;than I.</p><p>I'll be going at this from the perspective of an iPhone iOS 6 user, since that's my primary device.</p><p>Out of the box I was slightly frustrated quickly as I learned of the things that it couldn't do. &nbsp;"I can get my Twee...oh. &nbsp;I can get my Faceboo..oh. &nbsp;Well, at least I can get my SMS." &nbsp;Knowing that I couldn't get my Tweets on my phone wasn't an answer I could accept. So I went ahead and Jailbroke my phone ASAP to install <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/02/12/btnotificationenabler/">BTNotificationEnabler</a>. &nbsp;Success. &nbsp;Now I can get the notifications I want on my Pebble. &nbsp;A huge difference. &nbsp;Without this hack the Pebble sadly would be useless to me. &nbsp;It's just not enough to dismiss phone calls and read text messages.</p><p>The next thing I experienced was a period of learning to trust the watch. &nbsp;I'm used to my phone vibrating. &nbsp;Now my phone and my watch would vibrate at the same time. &nbsp;I'd glance at my watch, dismiss the notification, and move on. &nbsp;But a minute later my phone would vibrate again... but not the watch. &nbsp;Why is that? &nbsp;I had the setting enabled to remind me about missed notifications. &nbsp;The iPhone had no idea I saw it on my watch and therefore was going to remind me until I look at it on my phone. &nbsp;I dealt with this a couple days until I figured that Pebble was here to stay, so I turned not only repeating reminders off, but I also turned off vibrate on silent. &nbsp;My watch is now telling me what's going on. &nbsp;No need for my phone to duplicate that.</p><p>For controlling audio apps on iOS is works great. &nbsp;I feel it to be a bit odd that you have to launch the "music app" on it. &nbsp;It would be nice for it to detect that audio is playing on the device and switch to that for you. &nbsp;And when audio ends for it to switch back to the watch face. &nbsp;But that's a minor gripe. &nbsp;I've been using it to control both <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a> for Podcast listening and Spotify.</p><p>Not that I care about its watch, time telling, functionality, but it's fine. &nbsp;You can download different watch faces. &nbsp;My guess as time goes by there will be some really cool ones that become available. &nbsp;Right now I'm using the "Text Watch" that everyone else who owns a Pebble seems to be using where it tells the time in a "Five Twenty Two" format.</p><p>I wish it would queue up notifications. &nbsp;Right now if another notification comes in before you saw the previous one you won't see the first one. &nbsp;Doesn't seem like a big deal, but if you're at dinner with somebody, and trying to be polite, you may not want to check your watch every time it buzzes. &nbsp;In fact a motion that looks like you're checking the time every couple minutes may actually be more insulting than pulling out your phone. &nbsp;Having your phone out all the time has sadly been accepted.</p><p>As far as battery life, it's lasting about as long as I'd expect. &nbsp;I think around five days'ish for me. &nbsp;They're saying it should be seven, but close enough. &nbsp;However, I'm experiencing an issue where the Low Battery notification comes far too late. &nbsp;It's supposed to come when I have about 24hrs left, but usually it hits me when I'm around 1hr left. &nbsp;Without a charger at work (you can't get an extra cable at the moment), my watch will die before I get home. &nbsp;I'd prefer to get that notification in order to charge it the night before it plans on dying on me. &nbsp;This seems to be a bug, and I've sent them logs.</p><p>Aside from those couple small items it's been smooth sailing. &nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thecabin-mobile/id395148231?mt=8">Someone looking for me on IRC</a>? &nbsp;My watch lets me know. &nbsp;Someone mentions me on Twitter? &nbsp;Even if I'm half way across the office away from my phone, Pebble is letting me know. &nbsp;Delivery notification for a package sent to me via Push Notification? &nbsp;Now it's on my wrist. &nbsp;Not to mention the regular stuff like dismissing phone calls, reading emails, and seeing text messages come in.</p><p>And it has a backlight.</p><p></p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

      <title>Building TastemakerX for iOS</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/building-tastemakerx-for-ios</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's still in beta, and I'm still happily iterating over all of the features of the application, but I wanted to share the tools I used, the services I take advantage of, and overall tidbits that might be useful to fellow developers about how I've been building TastemakerX. &nbsp;Maybe you can in turn share some things with me.</p><h2>Tools that made my life easier.</h2>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1000.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/528be1a7e4b0e9c0c1eb997f/1384899015645/Screen+Shot+2013-11-19+at+2.08.04+PM.png.04+PM.png?format=original" alt=" Spark Inspector "/>  Spark Inspector [/caption] 
  

<h3><a target="_blank" href="http://sparkinspector.com/">Spark Inspector</a></h3><p>Both it and Reveal popped up around the same time, but since then I've been using Spark Inspector as a tool to debug view-related things. &nbsp;We've all done it, make a view's background bright green or whatever so it'll stand out. &nbsp;Now I skip that as this&nbsp;allows you to visually troubleshoot, move the frame of views around, change colors... basic stuff, but very helpful.</p><p>We've all had the "That view is supposed to be right there!". &nbsp;So you jump in to 3D mode, see where it actually is, and go from there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a target="_blank" href="http://cocoapods.org/">Cocoa Pods</a></h3><p>I was pretty hesitant to jump into Cocoa Pod land. &nbsp;If you're not yet familiar, it's a manager for dependancies. &nbsp;Somewhat&nbsp;akin to a "package manager" for Objective-C libraries. &nbsp;Like gem, or npm, pear in other languages.&nbsp; I saw it as exchanging Objective-C dependency hell for Ruby dependency hell. &nbsp;And frankly, I prefer the Objective-C version. &nbsp;But I experimented with it on some test projects, and saw that I had no issues. &nbsp;So I made the decision to use it with TastemakerX. &nbsp;I'm glad I did. &nbsp; I do a "pod update" after each release, and I know I'm always up to date. &nbsp;It also makes experimenting with third party libraries simple. &nbsp;Add it to your Podfile, "pod install", play with it. &nbsp;If you don't like it, remove it from the Podfile and move on.</p><h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cocoajsoneditor.com/">Cocoa JSON Editor</a></h3>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="380.0"]<a href="http://www.cocoajsoneditor.com/"  target="_blank" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/528be3cae4b009fd59304e38/1384899532059/Screen+Shot+2013-11-19+at+2.18.26+PM.png.26+PM.png?format=original" alt=" Cocoa JSON Editor "/></a>  Cocoa JSON Editor [/caption] 
  

<p>If you're building the client, but not the API there's often a stage of experimentation. &nbsp;This is where my experiments took place. &nbsp;I was able to quickly make requests against the APIs and figure out exactly what it was I was trying to get back. &nbsp;Not just for our internal API, but third party services as well.</p><p>It also really helps the scenario when you need a mocked up API endpoint. &nbsp;It allows you to create data models, and the built-in web server will map it to a path. &nbsp;Point your client to it and off you go. &nbsp;Within seconds you went from a non-existent API to an endpoint with mocked up data.</p>

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/colorbot/id434493897?mt=12">Colorbot</a></h3><p>I kind of wish this was a built in developer tool with Xcode. &nbsp;While I'm sure you're like me, and have your UIColor+CustomColors category, it's really nice to be able to visually organize the color scheme you have for your app. &nbsp;You use the colors everywhere, so they should be available, definable, and exportable.</p><p>So your UIColor category works great in your app, but where do you go when you need that color in your image editor? &nbsp;Or a CSS file? &nbsp;Colorbot makes exporting a color easy as a NSColor, UIColor, hex, and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Third party tools for working with Core Data</h2><h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord">Magical Record</a></h3><p>Both this and mogenerator was suggested to me by a friend. &nbsp;While I was hesitant to throw a layer on top of Core Data I experimented a bit and saw the advantages. &nbsp;The big win with Magical Record is simplifying handling Core Data across multiple threads. &nbsp;You really shouldn't be doing any Core Data stuffs on the main thread, so any way to make your life easier here is nice. &nbsp;It likes using blocks, and so do I, so we became fast friends. &nbsp;It'll give you the managed object context for the current thread you're in, and a block to do work in. &nbsp;The downside? &nbsp;Documentation. &nbsp;It's kind of all over the place. &nbsp;Certainly read through the header files.</p><h3><a target="_blank" href="http://rentzsch.github.io/mogenerator/">mogenerator</a></h3><p>A nice little utility that will take your Core Data model and create two class files from it. &nbsp;One with all the stuff a managed object should have, and one subclass where you get to put all your custom code. &nbsp;It really does make things more manageable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>External Services</h2><h3><a target="_blank" href="http://runscope.com">Runscope</a></h3><p>Run, don't walk, to get yourself an account with Runscope. &nbsp;At its core, it works as a proxy between you and your API. &nbsp;Don't let that scare you. &nbsp;Because it's the middle man it's able to capture, in detail, the activity of your application. &nbsp;Each request is shareable. &nbsp;So if in testing you see something weird you can simply log into Runscope, grab the url of that request and share it with whoever may be of interest. &nbsp;Even if they're not a Runscope user.</p><p>Other really useful things include bringing attention to&nbsp;all requests that have resulted in an error or&nbsp;requests that took too long to execute. Now with Runscope Radar you can turn a request into an API test template to make sure that thing that was broke stays fixed. &nbsp;Oh, and it pretty prints the JSON of each request.&nbsp; Could you do all of this with in-house unit tests, a copy of Charles, and your clipboard? &nbsp;Sure, but not this good. &nbsp;It just works. &nbsp;I wouldn't be overestimating if I said it has saved me days of work. &nbsp;And the same can be probably said for my teammates who I send Runscope URLs to saying "Could you look at this?"</p>

<h3><a target="_blank" href="http://crashlytics.com">Crashlytics</a></h3><p>If you're like me you've tried a few crash reporting services. &nbsp;Also if you're like me you've kind of been annoyed by all of them in some way or another. &nbsp;Crashlytics wasn't really on my radar until I went to the Twitter mobile dev event a while back. &nbsp;They gave a demo of Crashlytics and it caught my attention. &nbsp;It works just like any other crash reporting service, but the difference is it runs a service in the background on your build machine. &nbsp;This may bother some people, but it's nice that it's taking care of grabbing the dSYM and keeping track of archived builds without me taking extra steps. &nbsp;Because of this I've also not had to spend a single second manually symbolicating crash logs that Crashlytics hasn't been able to handle or because I forgot to upload the dSYM.</p><p>Another nice benefit, It allows you to set arbitrary keys as your user progresses through the application, so I know of things like the last artist id a user viewed, or a chart they were checking out. &nbsp;Oh, and it's free.</p>

<h2>Product Development</h2><p>When I started at TastemakerX one of the first things we decided was that we'd be making a rather large change from the idea of the v1 product they had already built. &nbsp;So we spent some time really knocking out what we wanted this product to be. &nbsp;During this time I still wanted to be working on some useful code. &nbsp;So I built some standalone sandbox apps to work out things like networking, image handling, Facebook Open Graph, playlist generation, etc as reusable classes I could seamlessly move over to a production app once we knew what the app would entail.</p><p>I know most projects don't have the luxury to start working on the application before they start working on the application, but it gave me a nice head start. &nbsp;Not to mention it enforces solid design patterns when you're writing code not knowing how you'll be using it later. &nbsp;There's no UI to contaminate your thinking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Some things I've learned</h2><p>I would hope every project I ever work on I'd learn something new. &nbsp;This is no exception. &nbsp;Maybe some of these might jog something you might want to look at.</p><ul><li>Storyboards are fine. &nbsp;Use them, or not. &nbsp;I don't care. &nbsp;This was my first non-sideproject storyboard from scratch application I've done and I made the mistake early on to try to *only* use the storyboard. &nbsp;Know when it doesn't make sense, and go create your nib files.</li><li>Don't mix up objectWithID, objectRegisteredForID and existingObjectWithID. &nbsp;Just saying.</li><li>You're probably not using NSSet/NSOrderedSet&nbsp;as much as you could be.</li><li>You're also probably not using NSCache as much as you could be.</li><li>Take advantage of iOS 7's <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:">performFetchWithCompletionHandler</a>. &nbsp;You have a background window of time to do some work. &nbsp;So instead of just fetching new data, maybe also do some of the post-processing you would normally have to do when the UI is up. &nbsp;Maybe pre-calculate the height of UITableView cells for this data and cache that for later, or if you downloaded some images that need to be resized take care of some of that. &nbsp;But there's only so much you can do in this window, so be smart about it.</li><li>Speaking of UITableView, check out iOS 7's <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UITableViewDelegate/tableView:estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath:">estmatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath</a> if it makes sense for you. &nbsp;It'll postpone the height calculation for a row until it's rendered instead of upfront. &nbsp;This makes more sense on older devices, but on the flipside you might see some frames drop the first time the actual <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UITableViewDelegate/tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath:">heightForRowAtIndexPath</a> is called to calculate the real height when the row is being built.</li><li>Aside from the audio playback manager, almost every instance of KVO I originally implemented eventually got ripped out. &nbsp;What seems like an elegant solution using KVO is probably just making things over complex. &nbsp;Think about if that's really the solution for the problem.</li><li>I have all network calls go through a singleton and fire off completion blocks. &nbsp;That's worked really well and in retrospect I wish I did the same thing with Core Data. &nbsp;On the same topic, if I were to go back (and might!) I would never pass back managed objects. &nbsp;Use Core Data for storage, and build standalone, separate objects out of them. &nbsp;Each object can have a reference to its Core Data counterpart for CRUD operations.</li></ul><p>So that's my little rundown on things I found useful or interesting so far with TastemakerX. &nbsp;I'd love to hear things that you're using to make your life easier or things you wish you would have known when you started as well. &nbsp;Have fun, mobile friends!</p>

      <title>Seeing my first Drum Corps show in 10 years</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/seeing-my-first-drum-corps-show-in-10-years</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/53a88fb7e4b0995e2e2b717e/1403555773177//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>I haven't seen a drum corps live since I was in <a href="http://kilties.org/">The Racine Kilties </a>in 2004. &nbsp;I don't know if it was me doing the <a href="http://renegades.org/chinesenewyear/">Chinese New Year parade with The Renegades</a> this year, or if enough time has passed where I was ready to see a show again, but I did. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.dci.org/schedule/details.cfm?event=223">DCI West at Stanford</a> took place this weekend and I thought I'd chronicle a few thoughts I have about the activity (as ruled by <a href="http://www.dci.org/">DCI</a>).</p><h3>To begin let's go over some major rule changes that have taken place, specifically in DCI, in the past 10 years.</h3>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/53a89169e4b0ebc91727104e/1403556242419//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<ol><li>Front ensemble and soloist amplification is allowed.</li><li><a href="http://www.dci.org/rules/pdf/2008/06_electronics.pdf">Electronic instruments (keyboards, synths, samplers, computers) can be used.</a></li><li>Voiceover/narration, and singing, either live or sampled is fair game.</li><li><a href="http://www.drumcorpsworld.com/?p=1100">Legal "Pre-Show" performance, allowing a corps to play anything before the official start of their timed, judged show is a thing.</a> &nbsp;This could actually include woodwinds, monster trucks, digital displays, laser light shows, additional people, etc as long as its use is stopped before the the officially judged portion. &nbsp;I say "officially" because the GE judge has to acknowledge this portion.</li><li>Any bell-front brass is legal. &nbsp;Trombones, sousaphones, whatever. &nbsp;The first step of this was allowing Bb instrumentation instead of the G bugles previously used.</li><li>A World Class corps may have up to 150 members, it used to be 128.</li></ol><h3>And some other notable notes:</h3><ol><li><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/BUSINESS/08/12/drum.corps.trouble/">Top Drum Corps have threatened to leave DCI</a> in general to have more of a "Tournament of Champions" deal. &nbsp;This to me feels like Star of Indiana leaving to do Canadian Brass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_Indiana_Drum_and_Bugle_Corps#Brass_Theater">Brass Theater </a>/ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast!_(musical)">BLAST!</a>&nbsp; This also creates a scenario where all crazy rule propositions have to get approved or the top 7 corps will leave DCI, and then DCI is pretty much dead, taking all the other corps down with it.</li><li>It seems corps don't own their <a href="http://www.dci.org/images/news/2007/04_20_2007_glassmen_buses.jpg">busses</a> and trucks anymore.</li><li><a href="http://www.dci.org/images/news/2013/03_29_2013_92_finale.jpg">Instead of the corps coming into formation for finale</a> they have a encore by some arbitrary corps first (not necessarily the winner), and then just the drum majors come out for the scores.</li></ol>

<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1403558163244_17155">And here are my thoughts, in no particular order.</h2>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="592.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/53a8981be4b0ebc9172722a1/1403557932393//img.jpg" alt=" The future of drum corps? "/>  The future of drum corps? [/caption] 
  

<ol><li><strong>I miss on-field warmups</strong>. &nbsp;While this new "pre-show" scene setting certainly guides you slowly into the show, for a lot of people it's about the corps. &nbsp;People like me love seeing them face backfield, blast out some notes, and prepare for battle. &nbsp;It's not beautiful, it's not graceful, it's powerful and it makes you excited as a fan for what's to come. &nbsp;Having a single guard member run across the field with a tambourine and have samples from the synth setting a mood does not make me feel like I'm preparing to watch a corps.</li><li>The only usage of "alternative" brass that I saw was from SCV's low brass section. &nbsp;They marched in with trombones in hand as well as their baris. &nbsp;I feared the worst. &nbsp;However, they only played them during the opening fanfare. &nbsp;This came off as a "<em>Screw you, we'll play whatever we want!</em>" moment, given they hauled this stuff around only to play it once. &nbsp;Just to prove they can. &nbsp;It was a good opening moment, though, so aside from it looking weird, I have no complaints. &nbsp;Yet.</li><li><strong>I still think G bugles are louder.</strong> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.drumcorpsplanet.com/forums/index.php/topic/97423-g-bugles-louder-that-bb/?p=1849867">Other people do too</a>.</li><li><strong>I don't like the narration.</strong> &nbsp;It comes off forced and pretentious. &nbsp;Having clips of dialog from movies or famous people might make the show designer think they're adding depth and context, but I find it <strong>jarring and unnecessary</strong>. It also takes my focus away from what counts, the performance on the field. &nbsp;It's easy to fall into a "<em>what are they talking about?</em>" instead of enjoying the show. &nbsp;I've seen a couple clips of other corps doing vocals online, and the only one that really worked for me was seeing <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x14isiw_2013-madison-scouts_creation">The Madison Scouts sing "Never Walk Alone"</a>, with the drum major conducting the audience essentially asking them to sing along. &nbsp;A beautiful moment given it's their corps song.</li><li><strong>I miss seeing the logos on the busses</strong>. &nbsp;Crossmen had them, though.</li><li>I thought the electronics (keyboards, samples) were used pretty well to add an extra layer of bass to some impactful moments in the shows. &nbsp;As it stands<strong> I think it's being used responsibly, and positively</strong>. &nbsp;Though I saw people who were watching the show via a webcast thought the opposite, as they were getting a direct feed from microphones and possibly the mixing console? &nbsp;I could see that being a far different mix than what I heard live.</li><li><strong>What's the deal with the retreat change? </strong>&nbsp;Having all the corps come out for the scores is one of the most exciting parts of the night. &nbsp;Having the encore concert afterward for the winner (or home corps) was always so powerful. &nbsp;As a corps member being out there next to all the other corps, next to your teammates, is something special.</li></ol>

<h2>My final thoughts.</h2><p>I will see a day where I can say "This isn't my drum corps" <a href="http://www.ishpemingbluenotes.com/">just like my dad can say the same</a>. &nbsp;DCI is going the way of any performance medium, where limitations, history, and constrained creative freedom have no place getting in the way of the show. &nbsp;Soon all instruments (yes, woodwinds too) will be on that field, and artistry will completely replace the <em>park and blow</em>. &nbsp;I also personally believe that when it comes to DCI (or whatever it becomes), it'll be less about scores and more about a touring performance.</p><p>When you go see Cirque du Soleil there's no score at the end of the night. &nbsp;They're not compared to other shows. &nbsp;You go, you appreciate, and you leave thinking about the great performance. &nbsp;When your favorite band comes to down and you see the three openers they're not compared to the headliner in form of a number.</p><p>But fear not, I don't believe that drum corps will die. &nbsp;There are so many great outlets for "classic" drum corps that I almost hope that DCI (and its member corps) yank off the bandaid so we can move forward. &nbsp;<strong>Let <a href="http://www.dcacorps.org/">DCA</a> be the organization for people who love drum corps, and let DCI be the group that manages touring marching arts groups around the world.</strong></p><h2>Viva Americanos!</h2>

      <title>Developing for Roku</title>

<p>Ask yourself,&nbsp;<em>"Do I know anybody who's developed anything for the Roku Media Player?"</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;More than likely the answer is no. &nbsp;If you ask others you might get get some response, but more than likely nobody you know has done it either.</p><p>And that's why I wanted to throw up a little piece about building for the Roku.</p><h2><strong>Chapter 1: I want to listen to Streaming Internet Radio.</strong></h2>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/547e9e8fe4b001b264e4c80e/1417584291798//img.png" alt=" Marantz audio reciever "/>  Marantz audio reciever [/caption] 
  

<p>For me it started innocently enough. &nbsp;I wanted to listen to streaming internet radio. &nbsp;I had been listening using my Marantz home theater receiver. &nbsp;This was ok, I guess. &nbsp;The interface looked like this:</p><p>Not awesome.</p><p>My next thought was the AppleTV. &nbsp;I use my AppleTV for everything else. &nbsp;The interface is pretty good, but not great.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1418004372636_39003">But then I learned of a major deal breaker: You can't add your own stations.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1418004372636_39004">So I looked at other options. &nbsp;Run an iOS app and AirPlay mirror it to the AppleTV? &nbsp;While that works that's not elegant in any stretch of the imagination. &nbsp;Build an HTPC? &nbsp;Get a Raspberry Pi? &nbsp;All valid options. &nbsp;But then I remembered that Roku had a ton of available content. &nbsp;Surely it must have what I'm looking for. &nbsp;Next thing you know I have a Roku 3 on order.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1418004372636_39005">It turns out I was right. &nbsp;The Roku had a ton of applications (they call channels) that focused on music and streaming audio. &nbsp;Here are some of them:</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><p>With the SHOUTcast Radio application being the only one I could find that I could add my own stations, I was a step further than I was before. &nbsp;But, as you can see, a lot of Roku apps have a very templated feel to them. &nbsp;I later learned why this was.</p><p>I started thinking of other features I'd really like. &nbsp;Last.FM Scrobbling, Adding to Rdio playlists, updating my room lighting with my Philips Hue system.</p><h2>Chapter 2: Why Don't I Just Build My Own?</h2><p>Before I knew it I was browsing around the Roku Developer portal. &nbsp;Things I learned right away:</p><ol><li>They have an open SDK. &nbsp;Cool!</li><li>You write in a language called BrightScript. &nbsp;WTF is BrightScript!?</li><li>Callbacks and async stuff happens through a "message port".</li><li>You have to support SD and non-widscreen TVs.</li><li>They have an approval process like Apple to get on their channel store.</li></ol><p>Sounds fair enough. &nbsp;Let's go through this.</p><p>But here's my disclaimer:&nbsp;&nbsp;I've developed one Roku channel, and <a href="http://forums.roku.com/viewforum.php?f=34">t</a><a href="http://forums.roku.com/viewforum.php?f=34">here are people who know much more about it than I do</a>. &nbsp;I did about as well as anybody who's building something for the first time with a technology would, and I'm only giving my initial thoughts.</p><p>BrightScript is fundamentally a&nbsp;bastardized version of BASIC. &nbsp;It's a language so obscure often a Twitter search for the word will bring up zero results.&nbsp; Roku's SDK provides you a limited set of native objects like Arrays, Associative Arrays, an HTTP client, Bitmaps, etc. &nbsp;You create one of these objects with a simple syntax of</p><pre class="source-code"><span class="cm-variable">myArray</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-variable">CreateObject</span>(<span class="cm-string">"roArray"</span>)
</pre><p>Everything starts with&nbsp;<strong>ro</strong>&nbsp;and it's weird to create an object by it's string name. &nbsp;But whatever.</p><p>But those objects are it. &nbsp;You can't subclass, you can't create your own first class citizens, and you are at the mercy of the SDK. &nbsp;</p><p>So without being able to specify custom objects it seems that any Object Oriented approaches&nbsp;are out the window. &nbsp;Oh no my friend.</p><p>This is where your new best friend, the roAssociativeArray comes into play. &nbsp;You'll use it for everything. &nbsp;And you'll use it for this too.</p><p>Let's say we wanted to build a simple cache class. &nbsp;We'd do something like this:</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/gabek/43502fd2d766f4828702.js"></script><p>So let's go over this.</p><ul><li>Your "class" is really just an associative array. &nbsp;( {} is the AA shortcut, like in&nbsp;other languages).</li><li><strong>m</strong>&nbsp;is a weird magical variable that points to your associative array as long as the function was fired via the declaration in your "class". &nbsp;In this case you obviously just can't call&nbsp;<em>"cache_add"</em>&nbsp;directly, you'd have to call&nbsp;<em>YourCacheInstance.Add</em>&nbsp;in order to get the magical&nbsp;<strong>m</strong>.</li><li>But&nbsp;<em>cache_add&nbsp;</em>is still completely pubic and accessible and totally confusing to people who may be reading your code. &nbsp;You&nbsp;<strong>shouldn't</strong>&nbsp;access it directly, but that doesn't mean you can't.</li></ul><p>Ok, so what's this port? &nbsp;It's <a href="http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/roMessagePort">roMessagePort</a>. &nbsp;And it's stupid.</p><p>Have you ever written a video game using a game engine? &nbsp;You have the game loop, where every cycle of the loop you can do things like move a sprite, check for collisions, make the blue box turn red... that kind of thing. &nbsp;Where in modern application development that kind of thing is abstracted from you this is mostly how Roku applications work. &nbsp;With one big <a href="http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Event+Loops">event loop.</a></p><p>So if you have a screen that you expect user interaction with first you create a roMessagePort object, assign it to the&nbsp;<strong>port&nbsp;</strong>of your screen, and then start the loop waiting for something to happen.</p><p>Here's a simple example:</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/gabek/80571f455cb769e81f86.js"></script><p>And yes, you&nbsp;don't use double equals for comparison.</p><p><em>"But what if you make multiple <a href="http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/roUrlTransfer">roUrlTransfer</a>&nbsp;requests and they start coming through a port. &nbsp;How do you know what each is connected to!?"&nbsp;</em>you're currently saying in disgust. &nbsp;Well our friends at Roku has come with a way to work around that obvious oversight. &nbsp;They added a <a href="http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/ifUrlTransfer#ifUrlTransfer-GetIdentityasInteger">GetIdentity</a>&nbsp;to its interface so you can compare request data coming in to the original request to see who owns it. &nbsp;Otherwise you'll be saving FancyPhoto.jpg's data to a file called importantdata.json. &nbsp;So you'll have to keep the original request data around somewhere while you wait for responses to come in. &nbsp;(If it's an async request you have to keep an active reference somewhere or it'll die in transfer anyway, but that's besides the point).</p><p>So with the basics of how you work with data out of the way let's talk about the UI.</p><p>Remember seeing a bunch of screenshots above that all look similar? &nbsp;Say hello to <a href="http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/roSpringboardScreen">roSpringboardScreen</a>. &nbsp;Just another piece of the SDK. &nbsp;You pass it some data and it lays it out to look like that. &nbsp;It's easy, it's fast, and it gets the job done. &nbsp;Roku supplies a ton of screens that do this type of thing. &nbsp;<a href="http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/roParagraphScreen">roParagraphScreen</a>, <a href="http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/roPosterScreen">roPosterScreen</a>, etc. &nbsp;The obvious downside is almost every Roku application looks the same.</p><p>So I took the approach early on that I wanted to do something different, especially for the "Now Playing" screen. &nbsp;So I jumped at <a href="http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/roImageCanvas">roImageCanvas</a>. &nbsp;It does what it sounds like. &nbsp;You can put images on the screen wherever you want.</p><p>roImageCanvas has a lot of niceties. &nbsp;A built in HTTP client so you can point to URLs instead of having to download things and handle local files yourself and being able to pass a simple array of things to draw are two of them. &nbsp;For most things this really should be good enough. &nbsp;But once I implemented my Now Playing screen with it I found I wanted even more control and flexibility. &nbsp;This is when things got dark.</p><p>Working with Roku's <a href="http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/roScreen">roScreen</a>&nbsp;is taking that game loop comparison to the next level because it's literally for building games on the Roku. &nbsp;But there's no middle ground between roImageCanvas and roScreen. &nbsp;If you want to do any kind of dynamic visuals on your screen you're giving up doing things Roku's easy way.</p><p>So let's talk about how to do some simple things with roScreen.</p><ol><li>Want to move a box across the screen? &nbsp;There's no way to ask an object where it's location is, so when you draw something to the screen keep note of its coordinates. &nbsp;Next time the loop hits you increment that number. &nbsp;Then redraw the object with the new coordinates.</li><li>Want to fade something in? &nbsp;Draw it to the screen as completely transparent. &nbsp;Then much like the previous example, keep incrementing the alpha value at the rate you want until it gets to the alpha you want.</li></ol><p><span>But you better watch out. &nbsp;Doing things like drawing text and&nbsp;drawing alpha'ed regions are expensive for the Roku to handle. &nbsp;Luckily roScreen does double buffering so you don't see a flicker while it's cranking through all of that heavy work like making words appear.</span></p><p>For example, you'd want to do this on every loop if you want to do any movement.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/gabek/4d2a281cef92c52f40fa.js"></script><p>But if it's static, and you have no reason to keep redrawing the screen, you don't have to.</p><p>This is when that requirement of supporting SD and non-widescreen displays comes into play. &nbsp;You have to make sure your UI within this screen lays out properly. &nbsp;Where if you were using any of the SDK canned screens like roSpringboardScreen all this would happen magically for you. &nbsp;Even roImageCanvas has support for this kind of thing.</p><h2><span>Chapter 3: Testing Your Channel</span></h2><p>And how do you test on old screens? &nbsp;Well if you have a Roku 3 it doesn't support analog/non-widescreen/SD, so you'd be like me and purchasing a second Roku, a Roku 2. &nbsp;After discovering there are major performance differences between the Roku 2 and Roku 3 you'll probably also want to purchase a Roku Streaming Stick in order to verify your application on all the hardware.</p><p>But after all that hard work you'll want others to try it out. &nbsp;And much like the Apple App Store, having your work publicly available is a source of personal pride.</p><p><span>Unlike Apple, anybody who builds a Roku channel can make it publicly available. &nbsp;You upload it to the Roku developer portal and they give you a link. &nbsp;Via that link anybody can install it on their device. &nbsp;This is great for getting a small group to test all your hard work.</span></p><p>The packaging process is simple. &nbsp;You zip it up, you upload it to your personal Roku, you type in a password that was generated previously, and you download it from your Roku to upload to their portal.</p><h2><span>Chapter 4: Distribute On The Roku Channel Store</span></h2><p>But just having it available isn't enough. &nbsp;You want it on their Roku Channel Store. &nbsp;Just like the Apple App Store that's where people discover new applications and where you'll get the users. &nbsp;But it'll have to get approved first.</p><p>With Apple a worst case scenario is about two weeks unless there's some special reason they aren't approving you. &nbsp;With Roku, let me put it this way: I uploaded my application on September 11th. &nbsp;That's right, it's been&nbsp;<strong>88&nbsp;days</strong>&nbsp;since I submitted for approval.</p><p>I did hear from them once about a month in asking me if I could upload a new version that listened on a different HTTP port number in my code. &nbsp;I did, and then I never heard from them again. &nbsp;I email them about once a week asking for an update, but never a response. &nbsp;This kind of treatment is enough for me to say <em>"Screw Roku!"</em>&nbsp;and why I'd probably never build a second application on their platform.</p><p>All this on top of the small things you might forget about when building for an obscure platform. &nbsp;Anything you've built before probably has a drop in analytics library so you can get your Google Analytics or whatever going without any effort. &nbsp;For me I ended up building a <a href="https://github.com/gabek/SegmentIO-Brightscript">BrightScript analytics package for Segment.IO</a>. &nbsp;Want other 3rd party features? &nbsp;Those SDKs they provide aren't going to work here. &nbsp;For me I integrated Rdio, the above Segment analytics, Philips Hue and&nbsp;Last.FM on top of my own custom APIs.</p><p>So in closing, I'm certainly not saying that you shouldn't develop for the Roku if you're thinking about it. &nbsp;On the contrary, it's a really fun challenge to build using an environment that's probably completely different than you're used to. &nbsp;And if it's a pure numbers game, there are more Rokus attached to TVs than Nexus Android Players or Fire TV boxes combined by an order of magnitude. &nbsp;It's not even close. &nbsp;But keep your expectations in check, keep your feature set low, and expect to get creative with the solution you come up with.</p><p>Or just wait until you can write for the AppleTV.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Launching The Bat Player on the Roku Store and its aftermath</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/7/4gcalw7f4b8p6supge0rfo4efrsfal</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a year of development The Bat Player went live on <a href="https://www.roku.com/channels#!details/47705/the-bat-player">Roku's Channel Store</a>.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/55add6cae4b0485b4e86e22f/1437456079788//img.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>The Bat Player first went public in September of last year. &nbsp;This means if you knew the right Roku Channel Code you could install it on your device. <a target="_blank" href="http://thebatplayer.fm">&nbsp;I put up a web site</a> to make this easier, and shared it with a couple specific communities like the Roku forums and Reddit's Roku subreddit.</p><p>My goal all along was&nbsp;to get it available in their mainstream directory. &nbsp;But between their approval delays (It can take months for them to get you in their queue) and many requested change iterations, it took some time. &nbsp;Add a period early this year where I took time off trying to get it approved, and you'll see why it took so long.</p><p>But that's not what this post is about. &nbsp;It's about what happened <strong>after</strong>&nbsp;it went live.</p><p>But first let's quickly go over how The Bat Player works.</p><p>As far as the audio aspects&nbsp;go it's&nbsp;a pretty dumb application. &nbsp;It doesn't really know much. &nbsp;Due to Roku's limitations with streaming protocols it doesn't know even when a song changes. &nbsp;To overcome this I built a service, known as <a href="https://github.com/gabek/TheBatPlayerServer">The Bat Server&nbsp;</a>that can be ping'ed with a URL to find the title of what's playing on a station via a variety of different methods. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-internet-radio">This part I actually broke out in to my first public Node.js module.</a></p><p>Easy enough, but that's not what I wanted The Bat Server for. &nbsp;I wanted contextual, useful information. &nbsp; So knowing the artist name allows me to grab some relevant information from Last.FM's API. &nbsp;That too, is easy enough.</p><p>Song information is more difficult. &nbsp;I query a few different services (<a href="http://www.last.fm/api">Last.FM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gabek/nodecogs">Discogs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gabek/node-gracenote">Gracenote</a>, <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2">Musicbrainz</a>) to get an array of possible albums a track could be from. &nbsp;Then I try to make an educated guess based on available information. &nbsp;This whole song and dance is pretty expensive.</p><p>On top of this the client makes&nbsp;separate calls to The Bat Server to do some image manipulation for a few things (dynamic header images, station icon resizing, building backgrounds and artist images) via ImageMagick on the fly.&nbsp;</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/55add64ce4b051d73ba489ae/1437455985226//img.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>All this happens every time a new song is seen by The Bat Server. &nbsp;It's not efficient, it doesn't work at scale, and it was living on one tiny server. &nbsp;But&nbsp;I only had about 800 installs. &nbsp;So&nbsp;I figured eventually when I got approved for the Channel Store I'd get a couple hundred installs more one day, half of those people would try it,&nbsp;and things would level off and I could reassess down the road if needed. &nbsp;I underestimated the Roku Channel Store.</p><p>Once it was available thousands of new users&nbsp;brought The Bat Server to its knees the first day. &nbsp;My single t2.small EC2 instance was not up to the task, though in retrospect I did have&nbsp;a few things early on that I'm really thankful for now. &nbsp;</p><p>I cached everything. &nbsp;Data gets saved to Memcache, so an Artist, Album, Song only gets processed once. &nbsp;Also, images get pulled through Amazon Cloudfront. &nbsp;So those crazy dynamic images eventually make it to the edge servers and won't touch my server again. &nbsp;And lastly I put <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> in front of the Node.js service as a way to have a handle on how long a previous request can stay as a cached result before we go to the internet radio station to determine what's playing again. &nbsp;If all fails I can dial up the cache duration.</p><p>I also added centralized logging and Analytics&nbsp;not just&nbsp;from the service, but also from the clients themselves. I did this with an <a href="https://github.com/gabek/Amplitude-Brightscript">Amplitude library I released</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;syslog client I built into the client. Both written in Brightscript. &nbsp;I wanted insight on what was going out in the field.</p><p>But no amount of caching or logging was going to save this. &nbsp;Luckily I was already using EC2 for my existing instance, but now it was time to put myself through a self-run AWS Bootcamp.</p><p>First off, I needed to handle the new load. &nbsp;So I created a new t2.large and an Elastic Load Balancer. &nbsp;I pointed DNS for the existing server to the load balancer and put the two servers behind it. &nbsp;Things became much happier quickly, but I knew this was only a stop-gap measure. &nbsp;I needed some auto-scaling action.</p><p>Since I added the t2.large I bought myself some time to figure out what the best AWS CloudWatch metrics would be in my situation to scale capacity. &nbsp;At first my alarms were a bit too aggressive, causing servers to go in and out pretty frequently, but I eventually leveled them out, finally feeling confident enough to pull the t2.large out of the load balancer and let the system manage itself.</p>

<p>With this new infrastructure I needed some insight into it, so between <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> for API monitoring (I so love this service), <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> for server monitoring, <a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a> for the above logging, <a href="https://rollbar.com/">Rollbar</a> for Node.js application error reporting, and <a href="http://datadoghq.com">Datadog</a> I was able to put it all into one nice little interface. &nbsp;Add <a href="http://zapier.com">Zappier</a> and <a href="https://pushover.net">Pushover</a> with some webhooks&nbsp;and I now get custom alerts right to my Apple Watch. &nbsp;But man am I paying for a lot of services now. &nbsp;I hope once some time passes without any incident I can get rid of some of these services.</p><p>So now what? &nbsp;Well obviously things aren't perfect yet. &nbsp;Each server has its own instance of Varnish, so that's pretty stupid. &nbsp;But that's a side effect of my reactive-scaling. &nbsp;So maybe I'll [Varnish] -&gt; ELB -&gt;&nbsp;[Servers], but that would require an additional, full time EC2 instance just for caching, plus I read that putting an ELB behind Varnish isn't terribly awesome. &nbsp;I never thought I'd miss managing F5 BIG-IPs!</p><p>So what did I learn? &nbsp;The obvious, really. &nbsp;If you're going to build a single-homed, power hungry service, be prepared to scale horizontally. &nbsp;And what I did to fix it wasn't novel, it's what these AWS resources were created for. &nbsp;I also learned that the extra effort I put in up front both for analytics and logging made it easier to know what was going on. &nbsp;And lastly, utilizing the Right Tools For The Job<strong>™, </strong>in this case memcache, varnish, and the array of services from AWS, really allowed me to take something that would have only handled a few hundred users initially to something that I feel confident I can scale out to any size.</p><p>Enjoy the tunes!&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Goodbye, Rdio</title>
      <link>/blog/goodbye-rdio</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like everybody else, I felt like I had heard every song on Pandora by the time I discovered Rdio. &nbsp;I was user number 4075, a paid unlimited user, signing up on June 6, 2010. &nbsp;I was really happy to hear anything I wanted. &nbsp;I used the Rdio Desktop client to create a collection on the service with my local iTunes Library. &nbsp;I listened to it a lot.</p><p>Like many others, I moved to Spotify once it finally came to the US. &nbsp;I don't recall why exactly, but if I know myself like I think I do it was simply because I wanted to try something else. &nbsp;But I always thought as Rdio as the service for music lovers.</p><p>I ended up with a role at Rdio due to an acquisition. &nbsp;They were bringing in the TastemakerX team. &nbsp;There were other places the TMX team could have landed, but I wanted it to be Rdio. &nbsp;It was perfect. &nbsp;Just the right size, opportunities for growth, and most of all I'd be working on a product that people really, really loved.</p><p>I worked on handful of very different things while at Rdio. &nbsp;When I joined they were midway through a major redesign. &nbsp;I jumped in cranking out parts of the UI that still needed to be done.</p><p>I did a hardware integration for Jaguar/Landrover using Bosch's technology. &nbsp;I doubt many people have seen that work, but it was cool to be working with hardware.</p><p>I think I was the only engineer that started and finished the Rdio Live project. &nbsp;Live wasn't a popular feature within the company, and I understand that it only happened for political and business reasons. &nbsp;But by the the time it launched people thought it was cool. &nbsp;And it was. &nbsp;We got terrestrial radio seamlessly integrated into an on-demand service. &nbsp;It worked way better as an experience than I thought it would. &nbsp;It even brought in new users. &nbsp;I was told it was the most friction and hassle free launch in Rdio's history. &nbsp;So that's something.</p><p>The mobile team was small. &nbsp;Probably too small. &nbsp;But I preferred it that way. &nbsp;I got to work on every piece of the codebase. &nbsp;Sure, the original app was in C#, due to a decision by people no longer at the company, to utilize Xamarin, but the current team didn't want it, or like it. &nbsp;So we started rewriting it. &nbsp;We were building from the ground up,&nbsp;in Swift (with some Objective-c),&nbsp;a new iOS application that will never see the light of day. I was focusing on the playback engine, something I've never done a deep dive into before. &nbsp;As a side effect of Swift being new, and C# being new to me, this means I developed in two new languages in under a year and a half on a daily basis. &nbsp;So again, that's something.</p><p>I may be the only person who received an offer from Pandora who feels about 50/50 if they will accept it or not. &nbsp;I always told people Rdio is about as large of a company as I'd want to be at. &nbsp;When I started I think it was just around 150 people. &nbsp;It's probably closer to 200 globally now. &nbsp;Pandora touts 1800+ employees. &nbsp;I asked representatives to explain how I won't get lost in a sea of engineers. &nbsp;They couldn't tell me I wouldn't. &nbsp;They couldn't tell me I'd matter.</p><p>There's a possibility I'm more touchy about this than the rest of my team because this is the second time I've been acquired in two years. &nbsp;Maybe I feel like I'm being pushed around with no control over my own destiny. &nbsp;That I can be bought and sold to the highest bidder. &nbsp;I don't actually feel this way, I can walk away at any time. &nbsp;But the fact that it's come to mind at all means there might be something to it.</p><p>Rdio's shutdown isn't just a loss to me, or the people I share an office with every day. &nbsp;It's a loss to the world of music. &nbsp;Rdio was the service for music lovers, by music lovers. &nbsp;In this world of The Streaming Services vs. The Music Business it's not enough to love music to keep the lights on. &nbsp;There's no guarantee Pandora can do any better. &nbsp;They're the ones, prior to their IPO, who were petitioning the copyright royalty board every few years saying they'd go out of business if rates were hiked up. &nbsp;They're trying to pay less to artists. &nbsp;The same artists who are already trying to put the streaming services out of business. &nbsp;So I'm not sure how this can end well.</p><p>Regardless of any of this, Rdio will be a thing of the past soon. &nbsp;A story about a fantastic product sold in a fire sale because the music streaming industry is brutal. &nbsp;But I'm really lucky to have been a part of it, even for a short time. &nbsp;Goodbye, Rdio. &nbsp;You had too much empty whitespace.</p><iframe width="500" height="500" src="https://rd.io/i/QFCpL6v4nA/" frameborder="0"></iframe>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why I love developing for the Apple TV</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/7/7t5petnotkyqalnv048w45tvq2yhid</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?--></p><p>tvOS isn’t getting the credit it deserves. I've found Apple TV the platform that I’ve had the most fun developing for in a long time.</p><p>The television is the physically largest canvas currently available. &nbsp;What has been a central point of the living room has historically been the most difficult thing to break into.&nbsp; The number of people willing to build awkwardly horrible “Samsung apps”, for example, are very few. &nbsp;Even the Roku, previously the most accessible developer platform, has a very small developer footprint.&nbsp;<a href="http://gabekangas.com/blog/2014/12/developing-for-roku">&nbsp;I wrote about developing for Roku previously</a>. &nbsp;Having the power, flexibility and ubiquity of UIKit allowing you to turn this canvas into anything you can imagine is really very gratifying.</p><p>But just being able to build for the big screen alone isn't why I enjoy developing for the Apple TV. &nbsp;There are real things that make tvOS apps better than their mobile counterparts.</p><p>As a developer, how many times have you sat with your designer talking about the tap target sizes of UI elements in your iOS application? &nbsp;I’ll venture to guess it’s more than you’d like. &nbsp;But this isn’t a problem with tvOS’ Focus Engine. &nbsp;Anything that’s selectable is made obvious via the elements as you explore each screen with your remote. &nbsp;It doesn’t matter how small the element is, with the Focus Engine it’ll jump out at you. &nbsp;The defaults with UIKit elements literally make these items larger when selected, and with UICollectionView, you can directly manipulate them via remote gestures. &nbsp;This is even better than direct manipulation on a phone or tablet surface where your figures cover up the element you’re interacting with.</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1030.0"]<a href="https://medium.com/@flarup/designing-for-the-apple-tv-5992c3aab1e4#.71q02v28u"  target="_blank" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/57866828d2b857c40a675299/1468426382498//img.gif" alt=" Image courtesy of https://medium.com/@flarup/designing-for-the-apple-tv-5992c3aab1e4#.71q02v28u "/></a>  Image courtesy of https://medium.com/@flarup/designing-for-the-apple-tv-5992c3aab1e4#.71q02v28u [/caption] 
  

<p>I'll be the first to admit the navigation paradigms of iOS applications have a lot to be desired. &nbsp;It really does cause cognitive overhead for a user as sometimes screens “come from the side” in a Navigation Controller stack, but others “come from the bottom” as a presented modal. &nbsp;And then there’s nav stacks within modals and gestures with custom transitions all adding a whole other level of what seems like no rhyme or reason to the user. &nbsp;This has been simplified with tvOS. &nbsp;If you navigate to a new screen, regardless of how the developer is presenting it, there is no difference in the appearance. &nbsp;Pushing to the stack looks the same as if you’re presenting a view controller. &nbsp;And what’s best, the <strong>Menu</strong> button always brings you back to where you came from, regardless of how you got there. &nbsp;The developer may be forking you off in any number of navigation trees, but the user doesn’t have to know or care about it. &nbsp;You can save those discussions about your overly complex navigation architecture and go get a nice coffee with this time instead.</p><p>Of course there are exceptions to everything I've stated. &nbsp;You could easily create custom focused appearances that makes something hard to find, or any number of crazy navigation schemes. &nbsp;But the point is that tvOS was built for simplicity. &nbsp;Sure, every mobile app developer will tell you they're trying to get you to the most important thing in the least number of taps possible, but it's obvious that's only partially true. &nbsp;iOS applications don't usually adhere to the "If it's not important, leave it out" category. &nbsp;tvOS apps (at least currently)&nbsp;do. &nbsp;Content is the priority, not share sheets, find friends and "OMG Rate Me on the Appztore Plz" popups.</p><p>I've only had the privilege of building one application for The Apple TV, the same one I built for Roku,&nbsp;<a href="http://thebatplayer.fm">The Bat Player</a>, and it's been a fantastic experience. &nbsp;I encourage you if you have an idea that works for the big screen to build it. &nbsp;Especially applications, since there's currently a ton of games, but not a lot else.</p><p>Feel free to reach out if you're building something cool for the Apple TV, I'd love to hear about it.</p>

      <title>Introducing Longtail Music</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/4/introducing-longtail-music</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/214576527?wmode=opaque&amp;api=1" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" title="Longtail Music Promo" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
 
<p>It's no secret I've been frustrated with music discovery for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since <a href="http://gabekangas.com/blog/goodbye-rdio">Rdio shut down</a> I've listened to less music on mainstream services.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I do have a <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/gabek">Spotify account</a>, I tend to only use it to listen to old playlists and comfort music.</p><p>Where music discovery has been successful for me, however, is with internet radio. &nbsp;Having a person with deep knowledge within a certain style hand-picking tracks for me every day has proven time and time again that it's a system that works.</p><p>I built <a target="_blank" href="http://thebatplayer.fm">The Bat Player</a> as the best way to listen to your favorite internet radio stations on your television.&nbsp;It's a client for power-users where you can add any station. &nbsp;But I wanted to facilitate an experience for a wider audience that wouldn’t already have stations lined up to listen to.</p><p>There’s no lack of internet radio directories. &nbsp;Many boast “thousands of stations” with no context or assistance for a perspective listener. &nbsp;If you’re lucky you’ll be linked to a web site for a station to learn more, many looking like they haven’t been touched since 1998. &nbsp;There had to be a better way. &nbsp;So I built <a target="_blank" href="https://longtail.fm">Longtail Music</a>.</p><p>I focused on a specific set of stations that met a standard of quality and ultimately resulted in me directly reaching out and inviting them on board. &nbsp;My goal was to create a “loosely connected network of independent stations”. &nbsp;The content on these stations is really great and I’m honored to have met all of the station owners who care deeply about their slice of music online.</p><p>With stations in place the first hurdle for a potential listener is determining what station to listen to. Longtail’s feed helps here. &nbsp;Feeds are how people consume content every day with bite-sized chunks scrolling by on every network. &nbsp;Browsing the feed gives you easily digestible snapshots of what is taking place allowing the style, personality and content of stations to come out. &nbsp;What they’re playing, events being scheduled and reactions from listeners are all analogous to what is seen every day on Facebook and should feel like home.</p><p>Instead of simply stating a certain genre is played, the actual content of the station is featured. &nbsp;It’s the difference between that person you met who says “Yeah, I love music. It’s cool!” and the one who says “I only listen to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzaha_W-S5k">early Ministry</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRu7Pt42x6Y">Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac</a>”. You'll know what you’re going to enjoy if you get the specifics upfront.</p><p>We live in a predominately single-dominated world. But listening to that one song and forgetting about it isn’t how you discover new music. Instead you hear a new song, track it down so it can be listened to obsessively, and then dig through the artist’s catalog to see what other stuff you’ve missed out on. I want to facilitate that workflow. &nbsp;That’s why every song is only a click away from being played on Spotify, the largest on-demand music service. So visit the list of songs you’ve “Liked” and add them to your playlists, dig through the back catalog, and listen on-demand again and again. Each song is a gateway to an entire artist, entire genre, or entire world of music you may not even have known about.</p>

<p>I hope I’ve made it clear so far that music is not a zero sum game.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is room to have both the Spotify Discover Weekly playlist algorithm and personal curators shoveling a steady flow of musical coal into your audio consumption furnace. Because of this interoperability is a thing I’d like to continue to focus on. &nbsp;That’s why on Longtail you can do things like use your Facebook or Spotify account to get a list of suggested stations.</p><p>I wanted what I call a “thin social layer”. &nbsp;Real-time, live, internet radio is a shared experience and that aspect should be emphasized. &nbsp;Knowing others are turning in and listening with you is a cool feeling. &nbsp;“Liking” a track isn’t just a meaningless gesture to keep track of songs for yourself, it tells fellow listeners what you think, potential listeners the content that is drawing attention, and is even a datapoint for the DJ to know the feelings of the listeners.</p>

<p>And lastly, I'm not just doing this for the listeners. &nbsp;Internet radio stations have been hiding in the shadows as long as I can remember, doing its best to keep the lights on, keeping up with licensing payments, hosting fees and more. &nbsp;I wanted a convenient, centralized way to collect donations from listeners. &nbsp;So if a station enables it you can help keep the tunes flowing by "Tipping" them and I'll make sure it gets to them.</p><p>It’s early days with Longtail Music, but I’d like to thank everyone who’ve supported the idea so far, including all the stations who have given feedback, suggestions, and encouragement.</p>

      <title>Why your tech stack matters (It's not why you think)</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/2/why-your-tech-stack-matters-its-not-why-you-think</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/5a762fc453450ac9093ce48a/1517694953069/What%E2%80%99s_New_in_Swift_-_402-480x253.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>Recently I've received a lot of messages from recruiters looking for an iOS developer to build with React Native.&nbsp; And while I generally don't care what technologies people are selecting to build their products, I find this to be a subject that I think warrants a deeper dive.&nbsp; But a disclaimer up front: I have a bias, and I only speak for me, not for any team I'm currently or have been a part of.</p><p>I'm going to focus on mobile development in this post, but it's as bad, or worse, with the desktop.&nbsp; Bad <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>&nbsp;apps, written with web technologies, are everywhere, and today <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/02/06/welcoming-progressive-web-apps-edge-windows-10/">Microsoft announced</a> that web apps are going to be first class citizens next to native apps on the Microsoft Windows store.</p><p>My experiences with different mobile development options have been with the best of intentions by the team who selected it.&nbsp; For example, I'm currently on a team I think nothing but the best of who have gone the React Native route with a good mixture of actual-native.</p><p>What I've released iOS applications with:</p><ol><li>Web only (Web view)</li><li>Hybrid frameworks (<a href="https://phonegap.com/">Phonegap</a>, <a href="https://www.appcelerator.com/Titanium/">Titanium</a>)</li><li>Swift</li><li>Objective-C</li><li>Game engine (C++)</li><li><a href="https://www.xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a> (C#)</li><li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> (Javascript)</li></ol><p>While I won't go into the details of each of the above stacks, I would like to use two of these solutions,&nbsp;Xamarin and React Native, as examples to talk about the realities in using them.</p><p>Xamarin is a development environment that allows you to write your application in C# while still using native Apple controls and frameworks.&nbsp; Business logic, networking, persistence, etc would only be written once.&nbsp; C# is a generally well-liked language and has a lot of features.&nbsp; While very different than Apple's languages there's nothing you really can't do at a language level.</p><p>With React Native the view layer additionally is abstracted.&nbsp; It has its own version of everything and only behind the scenes are the native frameworks and libraries even known about.&nbsp; Often they're not used at all and a replacement React Native specific implementation of what you'd expect is used instead. You'd write most things only once for multiple platforms, both from a business logic and UI standpoint.&nbsp; In general, you'll get mixed reactions from the developer community when asking about Javascript.</p><p>So let's use these two development environments and talk about a fictional new UIKit class that Apple adds to iOS, let's call it UITriangleView.</p><p>First UITriangleView will be announced at WWDC.&nbsp; There will be sessions dedicated to it with examples of its usage, details on using it in a performant way with Swift and Objective-C, and where you can go next to read more about it.</p><p>UITriangleView will then be available in the iOS betas.&nbsp; All of the iOS developers will download the new XCode with the new SDK and try it out.&nbsp; Blog posts will be written about all of the advantages of drawing triangles, and there will be deep dives into the future of triangles on iOS.&nbsp; Throughout this process the Xamarin and React Native developers are patiently waiting, since neither of these environments know about UITriangleView yet.&nbsp; Depending on the complexity of this new class, the release timelines of these organizations, and testing, we're talking anywhere from weeks to months to get it added to Xamarin or React Native.&nbsp; And it's likely to be buggy when it does since they're just learning about it, too.</p><p>When looking for documentation you'll find a lot from Apple.&nbsp; It's detailed and will get you moving fast.&nbsp; But you won't find this documentation for your non-native implementation.&nbsp; With React Native you don't access the class directly at all, so Apple's documentation is useless to you.&nbsp; With Xamarin hopefully you can translate the usage of the class into C# yourself, as long it's not using any native Apple language features, or you have a different way of doing things in C#.</p><p>Some new really cool 3rd party libraries might be built on top of UITriangleView.&nbsp; Maybe FUTriangleManager was written in Swift and takes advantage of the new class.&nbsp; Xamarin and React Native will never know about the APIs in this library so a process known as <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios.html">bridging</a> (or <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/binding_objective-c/walkthrough/">binding</a>, or linking) must be done where the developer wanting to utilize the library must write code that links the non-native C# or Javascript to native iOS or Android code.&nbsp; This process must be done for any library, SDK or 3rd party code that the developer wants to use.&nbsp; This bridge code must then be maintained throughout the lifetime of the application and updated each time the 3rd party code is updated.&nbsp; And given this 3rd party bridge you wrote only works for one platform your dreams of running the same codebase everywhere just fell apart.</p><p>All of these, and more, often lead people who use non-native development to hold off on new APIs either because they have to, or it's too much of a hassle.&nbsp; And that's ok.&nbsp; You don't need to live on the bleeding edge.&nbsp; But sometimes it's not even about taking advantage of new technologies.&nbsp; Do you have a partner that needs you to integrate an SDK of 3rd party code for any reason?&nbsp;&nbsp;And this means <strong>any 3rd party code</strong>.&nbsp; Analytics, partner SDKs, marketing, etc.&nbsp; Sometimes a specific version for your environment is available, and sometimes you'll be able to bridge it, and sometimes it makes more sense just to write your own implementation of it from scratch so you can try and share it between multiple platforms.&nbsp; Writing 3rd party SDKs from scratch probably won't fall into your idea of "easier" or "faster".</p><p><strong>These are what I think of as the hard facts surrounding iOS development.</strong>&nbsp; The technology, the implementation and the actual day to day usage of it.&nbsp; How much time you spend trying to get it to work by emailing Xamarin and searching React Native's Github issues.&nbsp; <strong>But I believe even more important are the soft facts</strong>.</p><p>What are the community events like that are held around those technologies?&nbsp; When recruiting how hard is it to find somebody with experience using your non-native choice?&nbsp; Are you going to hire native developers and train them when they join?&nbsp; How happy will they be one year, two years down the road when they're left out of all of the exciting new APIs coming out of Apple?&nbsp; How happy will they be when they go to look for their next position and have to explain that they built using alternative options and haven't written using supported Apple technologies in a while?</p><p>And, sure, it's a little "touchy-feely" of me, but as somebody who's been a part of the Apple ecosystem for a while I feel like I'm a part of something.&nbsp; When something new comes out we all talk about it together.&nbsp; We have Slack rooms and forums where we post questions, meetups at coffee shops, and events hosted by companies who are using these technologies.&nbsp; Once a year we show up at WWDC from all over the world.&nbsp; It's a real, tangible thing that you can feel and experience.&nbsp; It's a world you're a part of.&nbsp; It's not just a technology choice.&nbsp; There's a passion for the tools used.&nbsp; Many of the tools and developers with a deep history going back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a>, and I happen to think that's pretty cool.</p><p>Of course, Javascript people have passion, too.&nbsp; But you can argue <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-JavaScript-have-so-much-hype-nowadays/answer/Richard-Kenneth-Eng?utm_content=buffer680b5&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"><em>they have to</em></a>.&nbsp; And it's generally not a passion for devices and apps, it's for the web and the DOM.</p><p>While the holy grail of "write once, run anywhere" may pull you in, it's a promise that time and time again rarely comes to fruition, and I've personally seen many instances where it falls flat. Think not just about those hard facts (3rd party integration, new APIs, performance, compatibility, long-term maintenance) but also about the soft (developer happiness, community, recruiting).</p><p>Sometimes you just want to build a quick app, and sometimes you want to do and be a part of something bigger.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been very disheartened with the internet recently.&nbsp; Between Twitter's Nazis and Facebook's data collection, ad policies and democracy manipulation, I've begun to feel like the internet that I loved was gone.&nbsp; And as more people almost exclusively spend time using services that are run by corporate entities, these services are systematically <a target="_blank" href="http://apps-of-a-feather.com/">killing off third party access to their content</a> in order to lock you into an experience that they control.</p><p>While there are the easy targets of Facebook and Twitter it goes so much deeper.&nbsp; Slack has come to control chat, YouTube holds almost the entirety of user-generated video and people's entire photo collections are handed over to Instagram.&nbsp; And even though my personal email isn't hosted with Google,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/google-has-most-of-my-email-because-it-has-all-of-yours">"Google has most of my email because it has all of yours"</a>.</p><p>The internet used to be the great equalizer.&nbsp; It didn't matter what you looked like, how much money you had, or what circles you were a part of.&nbsp; The nerds and weirdos ran things, and it felt like home.&nbsp; Now people fabricate their entire lives to impress people on Instagram every day and <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/28/beware-the-pretty-people/">the business people, celebrities and "pretty people" control things</a>.</p><p>So instead of just watching the real internet that I cared about fade away, I put my time and money where my mouth is and picked one thing that meant the most to me.&nbsp; A piece of the internet that has been there every day for me since the day that I first logged on.&nbsp; And that's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a>.&nbsp; So let me quickly talk about IRC.</p><p>IRC was first created in 1988.&nbsp; It's an internet standard, just like FTP, the web or SMTP, IMAP and POP3 is with email.&nbsp; Anybody can run an IRC server and connect to each other to form IRC Networks.&nbsp; There have been networks of IRC servers that have been around longer than the web has.&nbsp; But in general, regular people have left IRC.&nbsp; And that's no surprise.&nbsp; When IRC was at its peak the internet was less mainstream.&nbsp; As the internet matured the corporately controlled destinations popped up and one by one people spent less time on IRC and went to where not only their online friends would be, but where they could find their real-life friends as well.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="https://freenode.net/project">Freenode</a>, an IRC network focused on software developers and open source, is the single exception here, where it's actually grown with the explosion of open source software.&nbsp; But even in this use case, <a target="_blank" href="https://tedium.co/2017/10/17/irc-vs-slack-chat-history/">Slack has become the new standard</a> when it comes to new real-time chat communities popping up online.</p>

<p>I've been involved with an IRC channel (chat room) called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.the-cabin.com">#TheCabin</a> on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFnet</a> since 1995.&nbsp; Some of my closest friends I met there, and I still talk to them there daily.&nbsp; Marriages have taken place because of #TheCabin,&nbsp; I've traveled to meet people I knew from #TheCabin, and people have traveled to meet me.</p><p>And you know what has changed about IRC all this time?&nbsp; Absolutely nothing.&nbsp; You can still log in with any IRC client that you'd like and start chatting with people from all over the world without giving up your name or email address, viewing ads, being profiled, or losing a sense of anonymity.&nbsp; No profiles, no data leaks.&nbsp; Just the internet like it used to be.</p><p>So if the "modern internet" kind of sucks and #TheCabin on IRC is great, but people still aren't using it, what could I possibly do about it?&nbsp; <strong>Try and make #TheCabin more like the other services.</strong>&nbsp; This means looking at modern internet products and molding #TheCabin into something that resembles it.</p><p>I asked myself <strong><em>"What if I were to package, market and treat #TheCabin as if it were a modern product?"</em></strong>&nbsp; And after a little convincing of my friends in #TheCabin, I put together a plan to put a new coat of paint on a very old cabin.</p><p>This starts with all the things any other product would have, beginning with an actual product marketing web page.&nbsp; And what do you find when you get somebody to this page?&nbsp; The same thing you'd find with any other product's home page:&nbsp; Next to all of the bullet points of why you should try it you'll find the links to the iOS, Android and web apps.</p><p>And how do you get people to this page in the first place?&nbsp; You make an ad and you run it where people are.&nbsp; Ours talks about #TheCabin in comparison with other internet properties and the gratification you get when you have a mix of real friendships, anonymity and not having to play the selfies/fabricated life/followers game.</p>

<p>So while anybody can join #TheCabin with any IRC client that's not what the modern internet user expects.&nbsp; A certain amount of convenience is required to get people in the door these days, so #TheCabin has a native iOS, Android and web app that make it super simple to join us on IRC.&nbsp; No servers, no learning about clients, channels, and protocols.&nbsp; You just go to the App Stores or click on a link like you would with anything else and you'll end up in #TheCabin not even realizing you're taking part in an open service that pre-dates the world wide web.</p><p>This isn't the first time I've released an app for #TheCabin, but it is the first time I've released one where the audience is new people instead of existing users, and the first time I've released on three platforms simultaniously.</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><p>But I'm not telling you any of this to get you to visit us in #TheCabin.&nbsp; If you want to, that's awesome, we'd be happy to have you.&nbsp; You might hate it.&nbsp; We might hate you.&nbsp; That's the fun of it.&nbsp;<strong>Though if you're somebody that thinks it might be inappropriate to be hanging out there (close connections and family members of existing cabiners, people who only know existing </strong><strong>cabiners</strong><strong> professionally, etc), then it's probably not appropriate for you to be hanging out there.</strong>&nbsp; But the reason I'm telling you about #TheCabin and our journey is because there's a whole internet out there that isn't controlled by corporate interests, that isn't making you trade privacy for services and isn't trying to sell you anything.&nbsp; So please,&nbsp;<strong>find a piece of that internet that works for you and hold onto it</strong>.</p><p>I know there's a limit.&nbsp; I can't seriously suggest we all start hanging out on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a>, running our own YouTube video hosting service replacment or trying to find a new <a target="_blank" href="http://quux.org:70/Software/Gopher/Downloads/Clients">Gopher</a> server that we'll really love.&nbsp; But do you use a non-Gmail email provider that you pay for and think provides a quality service?&nbsp; Tell a friend.&nbsp; Are you starting a community that requires real-time conversation?&nbsp; Maybe don't default to Slack and find an open solution instead.&nbsp; Want to write a blog post?&nbsp; Make sure you own your content and you're not just handing things over to Medium.&nbsp; Start your own website.&nbsp; Don't trust others to keep your stuff safe.&nbsp; Pay for services.&nbsp; When you give them money they owe you something in return, while free services have to make you a lower priority.</p><p>And as for IRC, there's still a future.&nbsp; There's a push to give IRC a facelift with <a target="_blank" href="https://ircv3.net/">IRCv3</a>, something I hope gets widely adopted.&nbsp; Adding features like supporting threaded messages, extended metadata, native web support, chat history, etc.&nbsp; All things that people come to expect after being used to things like Slack.</p><p>And trust me, I'm not perfect.&nbsp; I have a Facebook and Twitter account and I'm not looking down on anybody for what they choose to do online.&nbsp; After years of hosting my own website, I now use Squarespace.&nbsp; I use a ton of services both paid and not after years of learning what made sense to host myself and what made sense to pay somebody else to do.&nbsp; Heck, I'm running ads for #TheCabin on the very services I'm complaining about. But I like to think I can use them without giving my life to them, but I know it's a slippery slope for all of us, so maybe I'm wrong.&nbsp; One day you're using Gmail because it's free and the next thing you know there's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2018/06/starttls-everywhere/">only four email providers left in the world that are federating between each other</a>.&nbsp; You write one medium post and soon it owns all of your written content.&nbsp; You rely on Facebook 100% for your internet presence and overnight they change their algorithm and hide your posts.&nbsp; And before we all know it all we can do is use the <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> to remember<a target="_blank" href="https://www.oocities.org/"> all that we lost</a>, and what the internet used to be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My 2018 in review</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/12/my-2018-in-review</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I figured enough has taken place this year, enough changes have taken place, and I’ve worked on enough projects that a post recapping things might be worthwhile.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">To start, here’s a playlist of my favorite songs of the year that you can listen to while reading this post.</p>
 
   <iframe class="embedly-embed" src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fembed%2Fuser%2Fgabek%2Fplaylist%2F19O9V2b18geBYuRWo17fqb&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fuser%2Fgabek%2Fplaylist%2F19O9V2b18geBYuRWo17fqb&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmosaic.scdn.co%2F640%2F7f289e90ddb7bb04b51abcb0a0c8abc9e073d089997f86b60c8f790386efa16144af5e3ccc7c523be28ee5d01614983310f16f1f3746586affdf2f57ff72bd8dc442fbeeb681d09e36c4598982c578b8&amp;key=61d05c9d54e8455ea7a9677c366be814&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=spotify&amp;wmode=opaque" width="300" height="380" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
 
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>So what did I do with this year?&nbsp;</strong> It seems, looking back, I wrote a ton of code.&nbsp; Professionally I contributed to a Roku app, two iOS apps, AppleTV and Amazon Fire/Android TV apps.&nbsp; Outside of work I released #TheCabin for iOS, #TheCabin for Android, #TheCabin web app, an IRC Bot in Go and maintained Longtail Music and The Bat Player for AppleTV.&nbsp; It was nice to spend time on Android this year, something I’ve been wanting to do in previous years.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you’re following along at home, you might notice one application missing from the above list.&nbsp; <strong>Going into 2019 I no longer will be supporting or maintaining The Bat Player for Roku.</strong>&nbsp; This decision isn’t made lightly, as a lot of people use that app on the Roku and has enjoyed it for a handful of years.&nbsp; But Roku, the company, as of 2019, will no longer allow applications written with the original Roku software development kit to be run on devices.&nbsp; And while this sucks, it wouldn’t be the end of the world to re-write it, all it takes is time and energy.  And to be honest, I got pretty far in that rewrite.  But Roku, in general, has made life difficult for developers on their platform, and I’m no longer interested in developing for them. On top of that they break APIs in every OS version update, they don’t fix reported problems, and the development environment you have to work with is just horrible.&nbsp; So on a personal level, I’m done with Roku.&nbsp; I get to choose what platforms and environments to develop for in my free time, so I’m choosing to no longer support them with my work.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Even though I shipped a bunch of stuff this year, there’s one thing that didn’t make it out, my currently in-progress Mastodon client.&nbsp; I’ve been hard at work on it, and I had hoped to have a beta out by the end of 2018, but it’s just not done yet.&nbsp; I’m sure you’ll hear more about it in the coming months, but until then, learn a bit about Mastodon and check it out.</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Speaking of social networks, 2018 is the year that broke the camel’s back when it came to leaving Twitter and Facebook.&nbsp; But before I brief you on that, believe me, I don’t want a big dramatic announcement saying <em>“OMG I’M LEAVING”</em>, but I do want to explain myself.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Twitter this year deprecated a handful of important APIs for third party developers.&nbsp; <strong>That means fantastic applications such as Tweetbot, Twitterific and others were cut off at the knees by Twitter so people would start using the official Twitter apps</strong> instead of third party apps that many people, like me, preferred.&nbsp; You can read more about this at <a href="http://apps-of-a-feather.com/">http://apps-of-a-feather.com/</a>.&nbsp; After telling these apps they could no longer have full access to the Twitter feature set they had the nerve to email their users and say <em>“Use the official Twitter app because it has all the features, unlike the others”</em>.&nbsp; <strong>That’s like punching somebody in the face and then making fun of their black eye.</strong>&nbsp; This whole developer ordeal on top of the way the Twitter corporation handles their product, privacy, abuse, nazis, Trump, ads, etc… I just had enough.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As for Facebook, I shouldn’t need to explain myself much there.&nbsp; Facebook is a horrible company for all the reasons you already know.  The company needs to be burned to the ground.&nbsp; I highly recommend watching the two part PBS Frontline documentary called <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/facebook-dilemma/" target="_blank">The Facebook Dilemma</a> if you’re not sufficiently angry about Facebook.&nbsp; I stuck around on the service as long as I have because<strong> Facebook is the single thread that kept me connected to handfuls of people</strong>, and the local events that get surfaced to me through “the algorithm”.&nbsp; But admittedly I actually talk to very, very few people on Facebook, but that doesn’t mean it’s not hard to walk away from having those connections. But the hardest thing to replicate going forward will be the event calendars. I’m posting a link to this blog post on Facebook so people know where to find me, but other than that I’m done there.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>So if you want to chat with me online going forward, there’s options.</strong></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For private communication there’s <strong>no reason not to use encrypted messaging products</strong>.&nbsp; If you want to chat and you have my phone number, and use Apple devices, there’s iMessage.&nbsp; If you don’t use iMessage you can look me up on <a href="https://www.signal.org/" target="_blank">Signal Messenger</a> by number as well.&nbsp; You can also chat with me on Keybase: <a href="https://keybase.io/gabek">https://keybase.io/gabek</a>, a great security product with a wide range of features outside of just messaging.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As far as following me publicly, Mastodon is where it’s at.&nbsp; Follow me at <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gabek">https://mastodon.social/@gabek</a> and learn more about Mastodon at <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">https://joinmastodon.org/</a>.&nbsp; While I still don’t feel “at home” on Mastodon, I do think it’s early days.&nbsp; It keeps growing, and little by little I follow more and more people and feel out the different communities.&nbsp; But I feel strongly enough about it to support it with my time, money and effort by donating to their Patreon and building a dedicated desktop client.  I think Mastodon in 2019 has big things in store.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>So what will change for me in 2019?</strong>  Well, I should probably write on gabekangas.com more often.  The (rare) things that used to go on Facebook, and the tiny things I would post to Twitter was usually enough, so only a couple large posts a year showed up here.  I should write more, and about different and smaller things.  But given that there’s not really a network to share those posts out to, I’m not sure if anybody would see them.  I’ve thought about revamping this site, as well.  Moving it from Squarespace to a Static Site generated by Hugo, but that’s a lot of work unless I really plan on using it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And lastly, since I have your attention, take some time in 2019 to learn about the alternatives to the free online corporate services you regularly use.&nbsp; A great resource is <a href="https://switching.social/">https://switching.social/</a> and <a href="https://nomoregoogle.com/">https://nomoregoogle.com/</a>.&nbsp; The companies you trust your data to don’t have your best intentions in mind and I think we’ll see even more examples of that in 2019.</p>]]></content:encoded>
