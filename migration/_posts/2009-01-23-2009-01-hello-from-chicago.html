<p>I dragged Cassie (well actually she drove most of the way) to Chicago this week.  Been here since Tuesday night, and it's really nice to see the city again.</p>
<p>It is a little eye opening though.  Living here for so long, then going elsewhere, and then coming back.</p>
<p>All the odd looks and questions when I say I really do like Omaha, and i'm not just saying that to back myself up in the move.  All the logistics to do things and meet up with people. </p>
<p>I haven't used the CTA much at all, really ever.  A little here and there to go from place A to place B, but I pretty much drove myself everywhere.  I don't have a car here now, and I feel pretty stupid when Cassie gives me a look like "shouldn't you know this stuff?"  But I don't.  I'm not a CTA user.  I know how it works, I know how to get to simple point to point things if I plan out the line ahead of time, but that's about it.  So this trip is certainly overshadowed by her thinking i'm an idiot and I think she'd have more fun if I wasn't here.  That really bums me out to know you're holding someone back.  Especially when you thought you were doing something nice.  It sucks to to feel not good enough.</p>
<p>On a side note, my friend Corinne just moved to Chicago.  Go to her web site.  Follow her on Twitter, become her new Chicago friend.  She's fun.  Link = <a href="http://kandy.net/index.php">Krin!</a></p>
