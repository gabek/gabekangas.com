<p>I had a nice trip to Seattle last week.  It was really for work purposes, they were sending me to F5 LTM training, but I knew I'd be able to make it into a fun vacation as well.  I had no plans when going there, but that rarely stops me from having a good time.
<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2477/3764437904_fc44ac5ff2.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="The First Starbucks" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2477/3764437904_fc44ac5ff2.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="155"></a>Thanks to Twitter, and my blog, you're able to see a step by step recap of my whole trip by accessing my <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd19ff3/1355981318235/?format=original">Twitter archive page for the week</a>.  It's really pretty cool, check it out!</p>
<p>I did the tourist thing, went up into the Space Needle, but that's kind of where that ended.</p>
<p>I hung out with <a href="http://twitter.com/dtorgerson/status/2725897315">@dtorgerson</a> and had some drinks.  We chatted about some of our ideas we're working on, and he's doing <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3476/3764415304_a63f5fe912.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3476/3764415304_a63f5fe912.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="168"></a>some great stuff.  Really exciting.  He also was kind enough to give me a ride over to the Sunset Tavern as I had planned on seeing Mark Mallman that night there.  Mallman puts on a great show, so I was excited to see him again.</p>
<p>Spent that night at the Sunset and talked to some pretty cool people.  A girl I met, Betty, wanted me to email her the photos I took.<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/3764439956_2c47e6c0fc.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/3764439956_2c47e6c0fc.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="171"></a> Plus it's always fun to try the local brews of the area :)</p>
<p>Then I talked to @<a href="http://www.twitter.com/zria">zria </a>and she told me about the Capitol Hill Block Party, a music festival going on.  So Friday night I went there and met up with her.  The block party was pretty sweet.  Lots of great music and I got to mingle with my type of people.  The local music crowd.  Afterward she gave me a tour of the Capitol Hill area and then brought me to Shorty's.  A bar that has a room full of awesome pinball machines.  It was a really great time.</p>
<p>The next day she brought me to Pike Place Market and I saw some dudes throw fish around.  We ate over a place overlooking the market, and got some yummy coffee.  We hung out in a cool local record store in the Queen Anne hood and later got pizza there.</p>
<p>There was a lot of neat stuff that I saw when there.  The first Starbucks, so much good coffee, little stores and restaraunts, you get the idea.  Typical local stuff in a big city.  But I was lucky to time the trip around the block party and be able to see a lot of music when I was there.  Built to Spill and Deerhunter were performing as well as local bands I never would have heard of otherwise.  Very cool.</p>
<p>As I was there for work purposes,  I had class Tues-Fri, 8-5.  It was a really go<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2430/3763632299_c035bd75c4.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2430/3763632299_c035bd75c4.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="151"></a>od class, but I did fly through it.  I came off as the "know it all" in the class and people gave me dirty looks.  Oh well.  It gave me a chance to work with a couple instructors and talk about things that I do and would like to do with their products and really get an insight into the company.  Very worthwhile, F5 does very well with their training.</p>
