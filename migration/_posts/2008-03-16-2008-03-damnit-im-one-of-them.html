<p>I joined a gym today. Damnit. Now i'm one of those assholes. I told myself I wouldn't do that. Be throwing "Yeah, I totally have to go and work out tonight" into conversations to make yourself feel like... something. I don't know. But it's lame. And I don't want to be one of them. But I wanted to do it for myself, so I am. So I put $150 on a 2yr membership with Bally's Fitness because it's the closest to my apartment, and maybe i'll go often enough to make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>People who let a gym, or their bodies, or their health define them are stupid, stupid people that I can't stand. And I refuse to become one of them. I'm doing it only because I feel I should because i've gained some weight in the past year and I should take it off. Nothing more than that. I don't want to "bulk up", "tone" or in any way "feel the burn".</p>
<p>Just so you know.</p>
