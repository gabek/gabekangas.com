To start, here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist of my favorite songs of the year that you can listen to while reading this post.

Create the soundtrack of your year.
Now THIS is more like it! Though to be honest I feel like I talk about music to people so often I don't know what to put here that's worth reading.
It's actually pretty easy for me to find what I've been listening to this past year because of Last.FM. In fact here is my 12 month chart in detail.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Song Recommendation: Mark Mallman - Mother Made Me Do It</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/10/weekly-song-recommendation-mark-mallman-mother-made-me-do-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2010 10:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/10/weekly-song-recommendation-mark-mallman-mother-made-me-do-it/</guid><description>I haven't done a music recommendation post in a while. It's certainly not weekly, but I'm not changing the naming. I don't know, stopped feeling inspired, I guess. Well fuck if I don't feel inspired now.
I've always been a fan of Mark Mallman's. It started, like many of artists I enjoy do, seeing a show of theirs without knowing who they were beforehand. This is a prime example of the Gabe Kangas music/movie introduction theory.</description></item></channel></rss>
