And who knows how long it would have stayed as a draft, but Keith Flint of The Prodigy died this week, and given how much I owe to The Prodigy being one of my earliest electronic loves, I felt I should actually publish it.
My music taste and the different artists that I've listened to throughout my life is a big part of my identity.</description></item><item><title>Seeing my first Drum Corps show in 10 years</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2014/06/seeing-my-first-drum-corps-show-in-10-years/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 21:54:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2014/06/seeing-my-first-drum-corps-show-in-10-years/</guid><description>I haven't seen a drum corps live since I was in The Racine Kilties in 2004. I don't know if it was me doing the Chinese New Year parade with The Renegades this year, or if enough time has passed where I was ready to see a show again, but I did. DCI West at Stanford took place this weekend and I thought I'd chronicle a few thoughts I have about the activity (as ruled by DCI).</description></item><item><title>Stuff I'd like to do in 2013</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2013/01/stuff-id-like-to-do-in-2013/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 18:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2013/01/stuff-id-like-to-do-in-2013/</guid><description>I'm not a fan of New Years resolutions, but there are some things I'd like to do in this next year. All very doable things, but if you think that in any way you'd be able to help with any of them I'd certainly be up for pointers!

I was chatting over lunch today with this week's Coworking Wednesday participants about how I wished there was something different I could do. Something collaborative and break the mold of what an unconference session should be. I mentioned music stuff and @whatevermatt mentioned a drum circle. I thought about that a while (at least 2 to 3 minutes) later that day (today) and thought I'd see if I could pull something off.</description></item><item><title>Lost and Found: A video experiment started in 2006</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/10/lost-and-found-a-video-experiment-started-in-2006/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2010 13:57:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/10/lost-and-found-a-video-experiment-started-in-2006/</guid><description>In 2006 I was diligently working on my (still unreleased) new album "The Longest Post". With that I decided to create a couple music videos both as an experiment on if I could make something fun, and to have a visual way to distribute some songs. A couple apartment moves later and the hard drives with the music videos were lost.
Until now. In October, 2010 I found the hard drives while cleaning out my music studio and decided it was time to show them to the world.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Song Recommendation: Mark Mallman - Mother Made Me Do It</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/10/weekly-song-recommendation-mark-mallman-mother-made-me-do-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2010 10:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/10/weekly-song-recommendation-mark-mallman-mother-made-me-do-it/</guid><description>I haven't done a music recommendation post in a while. It's certainly not weekly, but I'm not changing the naming. I don't know, stopped feeling inspired, I guess. Well fuck if I don't feel inspired now.
I've always been a fan of Mark Mallman's. It started, like many of artists I enjoy do, seeing a show of theirs without knowing who they were beforehand. This is a prime example of the Gabe Kangas music/movie introduction theory.</description></item><item><title>Ice, Ice, Baby.

There's a problem though, an a rather large one. I don't want to. There's just too much going on, and i'm unable to focus on a large project like that at the present time. It's really bothering me. I mean, there's no timeline, so there's really no problem. It's my own thing, and there's nobody chomping at the bit to listen to this stuff.</description></item><item><title>Man, it's SXSW time already? How time flies. I'll sure not be busy.</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2007/03/man-its-sxsw-time-already-how-time-flies.-ill-sure-not-be-busy./</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2007 09:41:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2007/03/man-its-sxsw-time-already-how-time-flies.-ill-sure-not-be-busy./</guid><description>It's been a whole year already since I hadn't gone to SXSW 2006 and it's time again for me to not go to SXSW 2007. I don't have my hotel all booked and my flights are not ready to go. I won't be arriving in Austin tonight.
I'm really pumped about the panels that are scheduled, I can't wait to not see them.
Did you see the lineups of the bands?</description></item><item><title>So i'm working on music</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2007/01/so-im-working-on-music/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2007 19:32:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2007/01/so-im-working-on-music/</guid><description>I think I have about 15 songs now in various stages of completion. There's probably only two or so that are "done", another two or so that are barely started, and the rest all in between. I'm going through the phase now where I ignore all the original songs that I spent a lot of time on. During the holidays I didn't have much time to spend on music, so it was a good cleansing period.</description></item><item><title>Happy Days Off</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2006/12/happy-days-off/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2006 10:15:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2006/12/happy-days-off/</guid><description>Well, they're days off for me, anyway. I've been off so far this week, and this is my last day off. Wanted to blow some vacation days before I lose them. Wish I could carry some over, but I can't. Oh well.
Been spending most of the time on music. Most of it really sucks, so I find myself wanting to spend more and more time making it not suck.</description></item></channel></rss>
