Another live stream mix on The Bat Station! This was my first time doing a mix using Rekordbox, so I’m a little rusty with it. I tried to be a little more creative in chopping things up in real-time that caters to my inner musician tendencies. It’s cool to treat DJ hardware as an instrument. I had fun, and I hope you enjoy the music I picked out.</description></item></channel></rss>
