<strong>Description</strong>: PandoraFM is a web application created to allow you to sync your Pandora.com and Last.FM online radio experiences.</li>
<li>
<strong>Status: </strong>Version 3 of PandoraFM that includes artist information, custom Last.FM radio player, and Youtube and Flickr integration has been running with very little code change. As of this writing over 8 million tracks have been played through the PandoraFM interface. Many still rely on the service daily, but it's unlikely there will be any additional updates in order to stay away from "feature creep".</li>
