Listen to your favorite internet radio stations and discover new music, all through your Apple TV.

Itâ€™s a big screen experience, utilizing the space to present a beautiful interface focusing on details about each song and artist while entertaining visualizations bounce along to the music.

The Bat Player comes with a mix of curated stations and a directory that you can browse right out of the box, but any internet radio station can be added. Each station displaying information about the artist and song you're listening to.

For power users you can optionally add as many Last.FM accounts for "scrobbling", or if you have a Philips Hue lighting system add your bulbs to create an experience that reaches out from the screen to encompass your whole room.
