I had the most delicious steak ever last night. I went to [Ruth\'s Chris Steakhouse](http://www.ruthschris.com/) and it rocked. They flash cook the meat at 1800F, and the plate comes out at 500F. Had awesome sides of potatoes and some great desert to top it all off. My apartment kicks ass. The kitchen is complete and i\'m able to move everything in there now. I got home late last night, so I haven\'t had a chance to do that yet. But at least my microwave is no longer next to my computers, and my coffee machine is no longer in my bathroom.

It\'s pretty warm in there, so I have the AC running now. It has a thermostat on it so it\'ll only turn on when it gets hot, so that\'s nice. I\'m going to purchase a second AC unit to install on the opposite side, and that\'ll work really nice I think. Maybe I won\'t need it, but I probably will. I don\'t like heat, at all.

Maybe this weekend i\'ll setup my drums, I think they\'ll look really nice in there. Plus I need to get them off the floor. I won\'t be able to play them yet, but I will soon. I\'m going to buy [Mesh Drumheads](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/product/Hart-Dynamics-Kontrol-Screen-Magnum-Drumhead-?sku=445444) and [Electronic Triggers](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/product/ddrum-Trigger-Kit?sku=440025) to hook my acoustic drums up to my drum sampler. Then the drums will be completely silent, and i\'ll be able to play them all I want through headphones. I still have a \$100 gift certificate to Musician\'s Friend, so that\'ll come in handy when purchasing all that equipment for the big drum conversion project. It won\'t be right away, but it\'s certainly on my radar.

I\'m going to have to go out and buy a tv sometime soon. It\'d be nice to have. Being I want to purchase an Apple TV, but that\'s useless without a TV to plug it into.

I have a lot of things to buy, don\'t I?
