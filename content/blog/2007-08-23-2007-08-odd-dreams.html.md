So i\'ve had two dreams recently about me getting fired from my job.  Last nights was even more disturbing.

It included our new uber-manager from Omaha yelling at me on the phone and then bringing my case to some peer review committee to see if I should be able to keep my job or not. He said \"the choice was clear\" and I could no longer work for the company.

The one before that was with my \"manager\" firing me. But whatever. If he fired me i\'d probably just ignore him and still come back the next day.

So I decided on my next tattoo. It\'ll be this, but in black.
