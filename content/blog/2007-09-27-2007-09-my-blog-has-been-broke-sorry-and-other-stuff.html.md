So my blog front page has been broken. The actual blog wasn\'t, and still isn\'t. But my custom RSS aggregator page that has been working flawlessly for years now suddenly isn\'t. I don\'t get it. Whatever, i\'ll fix it at some point. For now, though, it\'s just going to be redirected to the weblog page. Now you can read. Happy days!

Got tickets for \*another\* Birthday Massacre show coming up at the Abbey! Wohoo. Going to drag MaryBeth with me again like for the house of blues show.

It\'s been fun talking and hanging out with MaryBeth lately. I haven\'t seen her for a long time. We were in high school together, she was a senior and I a Freshman. Then I saw her sometimes when I first met Marianne. A few weeks ago I was looking through an old saved buddy list file of mine and saw her screen name on it.

I\'m starting to feel better since i\'ve been taking my antibiotics I got last week. 10 day supply, so i\'ll be in good shape. Not to mention I got my crazy pills. My crazy doc tried to break it to me gently that i\'ll need to be on them the rest of my life and I said \"well, yeah. I could have told you that.\"

Work is.. eh. Work. Good days, bad days. Bad days are always due to the same crap. Me being ignored. Me being left out of knowing things. Khyle mentioned the other day on IM how important it is for the company for me to stay here. He\'s probably right, but I just don\'t like working with Eric. That\'s really the bottom line.

Hope all is well with all of you. It feels like a Friday today. Too bad it\'s not.
