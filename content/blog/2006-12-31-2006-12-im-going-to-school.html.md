Kind of anyway.[Berklee Music](http://www.berkleemusic.com/school/course?course%5fitem%5fid=499436&tab=6006864&program=music%5fproduction&usca%5fp=t) Starting a program for music production. Starting my first class January 8th. It\'s not real college, no college credits, nothing more than me wanting to learn things. So don\'t start thinking that i\'m into the whole school thing, i\'m not. But if you want to learn things, like I do, then that\'s cool. I see this as the complete opposite from \"I take classes because I should.\"
