Per recommendation of \@EternalCow I built a bot that puts a much needed appearance of Admiral Ackbar (\@AdmiralAckbar\_) on Twitter. He\'s warning (as he should be) to all who will listen that \"It\'s a trap!\" This is funny, but the most entertaining part is the fact that people are replying back.

See below for a real time update of responses to \"It\'s a trap!\"

I\'ll soon have itsatrap.org up :P
