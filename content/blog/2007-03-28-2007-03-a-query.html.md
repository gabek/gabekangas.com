If you take the peripherals and case away from a computer, is it the same computer? If you take the sleek outside face away from a mac, is it then just a PC? What\'s inside? Can it be rebuilt as something new? Or should it just get trashed? It\'s far from operational without any kind of interface.

What do the insides really mean?
