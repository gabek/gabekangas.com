<p>So today i'm saying my goodbye's at the Chicago office.  There's a get together after work today at a local pub and it seems like a decent amount of people are going to be showing up.
Just got back a few ago from my last ROM coffee run.  My secret crush, Lilly, wasn't there, though.</p>
<p>My desk is clean, things are packed up for me to bring home... another chapter closed in the big book of relocation.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have to finish packing.  That's primary goal #1.  I'm pretty much done anyway, but I'm being slightly paranoid about it.  If time allows I'm trying to piece together a Casey Tatum costume for Halloween tomorrow night.  If I can't, no biggie.  But I am going to go to Flat Top for dinner tomorrow and then hit a few of the Halloween hot spots.  I can't be out tooo late, though.  The movers will be there at 8am, and I need to be in tip-top, not hungover, shape.</p>
<p>But I guess everything is done.  Nothing more really to say.  I'll take some photos the next couple days with me and friends and then things begin anew in Nebraska.</p>
<p>Crazy.  Crazy awesome?</p>
