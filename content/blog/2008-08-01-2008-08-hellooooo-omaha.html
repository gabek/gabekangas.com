<p>So like I said in a previous post, the time to complain about my job and the direction of my role is over. it's time to start doing something to better my situation.</p>
<p>So that time started last night when I applied for an open position in the Load balancer/unix scripting/sendmail/qmail team in Omaha, NE. Unix! I miss you!</p>
<p>Does it sound like a great match to what I'm good at? Absolutely? Do I want to move to Omaha? Not really. But it certainly won't hurt to discuss the opening.</p>
<p>But you never know. It sounds right up my alley, all things i'm good at kind of rolled up into one position. We'll see what happens...</p>
