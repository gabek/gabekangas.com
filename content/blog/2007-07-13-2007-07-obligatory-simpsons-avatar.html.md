I wouldn\'t be a member of the 2.0 Digerati if I didn\'t post my personal Simpsons avatar, now would I?  [![Gabe-Simpsons](http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/gabe-simpsons-tm.jpg){width="37" height="100"}](http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/gabe-simpsons.png)

Yeah, it doesn\'t really look like me. It\'s really as close I could get, though.
