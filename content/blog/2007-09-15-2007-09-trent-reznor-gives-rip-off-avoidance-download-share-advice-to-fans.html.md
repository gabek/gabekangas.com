> As for the special situation in China, it does not seem to be easy to > obtain Western music via legal channels, so I have the following > suggestion for our fans: If you can find and buy our legal CDs, I > express my thanks for your support. If you cannot find it, I think > that downloading from the Internet is a more acceptable option than > buying pirated CDs. Our music is easy to find on the Internet, and you > might not need to spend much effort to find most of our songs. If you > like our songs after you've heard them, please feel free to share it > with your friends. As I have put all my effort and heart into my > music, I sincerely hope that more and more people can share the > enjoyment with us.
