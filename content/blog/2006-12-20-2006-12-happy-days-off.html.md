Well, they\'re days off for me, anyway. I\'ve been off so far this week, and this is my last day off. Wanted to blow some vacation days before I lose them. Wish I could carry some over, but I can\'t. Oh well.

Been spending most of the time on music. Most of it really sucks, so I find myself wanting to spend more and more time making it not suck. I\'m generally unsuccessful.

But there are a lot of things going on in a handful of songs, so I think i\'m getting somewhere.

Beck said before releasing his most recent album that new releases from artists should combine not only the audio of a new CD, but videos, mashups, remixes, and the ability to customize the experience to the user. I agree with all of that. Even though I don\'t think DJ Tiesto will be knocking on my door anytime soon to do a remix to any of my tracks, there are communities online that enjoy remixing other people\'s work. I\'ll see if I can get involved. Plus I hope to have some music videos ready when the music is done. I\'d love to have other people involved in that too, but it takes a lot of time.

New YouTube video of my antics behind the mixer went up last night.  Enjoy.

So that\'s that. Back to work!
