<p>Today is our company outing. We're getting lunch, going on a boat cruise on the Chicago River, and then food and drinks at a bar &amp; grill. As long as nothing breaks before noon, we'll actually be able to go this time. Last time was cancelled due to production issues we had to tend to.</p>
<p>So who else saw that <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/s83522y/event/index.html?internal=g4h5jl83a">Apple announcement</a> yesterday? Everyone, right? Man oh man oh man. That iPod touch will be mine. Multitouch, wifi, Safari??? It's more than I ever expected from the rumored touch screen iPod. If not the iPod touch i'd love to also get an iPod Fatty (nano), or the updated Classic. My iPod is a G4 iPod Photo, and i've been waiting for this day to refresh it. But i'll have to save up a few bucks in order to do that. An exciting few months for my precious Apple. iPhone, new iPods and next month OS X 10.5, Leopard. I'm really looking forward to Leopard probably more than anything else.</p>
<p>Another great moment that should take place today is ekpneo getting his Treo! Wohoo! I shipped him the Treo 700p that the ex gave me when we got divorced. I certainly don't want it, and it's not worth selling it, as used phones are worth $0. So this is really the best of both worlds, I don't have to hold on to it, he gets to have it. He'll be able to IRC from anywhere now, and i'm excited for him.</p>
<p>Hope the rest of the week is quiet for everyone.</p>
