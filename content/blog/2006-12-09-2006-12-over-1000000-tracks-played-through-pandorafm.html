<p>On July 1st of this year I started a counter on how many songs are being played through the PandoraFM interface.  I haven't really been paying attention to it lately, in any aspect.  I just let it run.  I haven't been changing, fixing.. doing anything to it.  I'm actually quite proud of that, it's running well for a ton of people and i'm not having to make daily fixes.  I guess all that time I spent on version 3 paid off in the end.
Anyway, I checked out the "Social" tab today, and saw:</p>
<p><em>Over 1,052,000 other tracks have been submitted to Last.FM profiles through PandoraFM. * Thanks for being a part of it!</em></p>
<p>Wow!  Big number!  It's smaller than a lot of other numbers in the world, but that's my number!  Thanks everyone!
Gabe is currently listening to Imogen Heap - Hide &amp; Seek (DJ Russ Harris Extended Mix) on PandoraFM</p>
