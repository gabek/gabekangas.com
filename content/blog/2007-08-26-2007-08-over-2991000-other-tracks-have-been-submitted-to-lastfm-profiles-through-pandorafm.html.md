Crazy. It\'s been over a year since PandoraFM v3 was released, and I haven\'t really touched it at all since then. And it still works, and people still use it.

This fact clicked today when I ran into a post on a tech site about someone discovering it for the first time and thought it rocked. Here I am thinking it\'s 10min from death, and someone else thinks it\'s a brand new rockin site.

\"Over 2,991,000 other tracks have been submitted to Last.FM profiles through PandoraFM.\"

Big number.
