<p>Seven days from today I'll be on my way to Omaha. A moving company is coming first thing Saturday morning to put everything on a truck and off I go. Sounds so simple.</p>
<p>In honor of me leaving, I put together a quick collection of some photos of random times/events/entertaining things that took place here. I have another week to make some more great memories, but here's a little selection so far.</p>
<p><a href="http://gallery.me.com/gabekangas#100182">So here's some awesome photos. Enjoy.</a></p>
