<p>Does anyone else get these things from Facebook "Compare People"? It's always interesting how you're ranked compared to others. Here's my current standings:</p>
<p>#1 craziest (gained 1 place)<br>
#2 person with the best taste in music (gained 1 place)<br>
#3 nicest (gained 1 place)<br>
#5 best room-mate (gained 1 place)<br>
#6 most entertaining (gained 1 place)</p>
<p>Best room-mate? Really? I'd be the worst. I've only lived with one person before, and it ended awful. We accidently got married one time.</p>
