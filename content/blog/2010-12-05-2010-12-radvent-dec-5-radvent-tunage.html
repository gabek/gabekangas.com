<p style="text-align: center;">Create the soundtrack of your year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now THIS is more like it!  Though to be honest I feel like I talk about music to people so often I don't know what to put here that's worth reading.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's actually pretty easy for me to find what I've been listening to this past year because of Last.FM.  <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Gabek/charts?rangetype=year&amp;subtype=artists" target="_blank">In fact here is my 12 month chart in detail.</a> However, this year I haven't really been "into" anything significantly like most years.  It's certainly been a soundtrack of a year built of previous years and a couple new discoveries.  But unlike years where I can say "I was really into Daft Punk" or "I discovered the new pornographers this year" this year has been a pretty casual listening time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course Nine Inch Nails has been a staple, but there's nothing new there.  Though I really enjoy any live releases that happen to come out from shows, so there's generally always been something new to listen to.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ghostland Observatory came out with a new album this year, "Codename: Rondo" and I've given that a few e-rotations.  They ended up pretty high in my list with 119 plays.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Crystal Castles also came out with a new release this year, and I've played them a bit.  Well, only 85 times.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I went to see Lords of Acid this year, and around that time I was playing them quite a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Blaqk Audio is an electronic dancey group that I never would have heard of if @andrea_joi didn't suggest them to me.  They get a pretty constant play rate in my rotation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you organize my music <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Gabek/charts?rangetype=year&amp;subtype=tracks" target="_blank">by what tracks I listened to the most</a> it gets even a little more broad.  Is that Semisonic's 2001 hit "Chemistry" way up on the charts?  Yes it is.  And that, my friends, shows you that it's been kind of a down year when it comes to tunes for me.  (Don't get me wrong, I really like that song.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For some reason "Shiny Toy Guns" was a staple this year as well.  But that's some feel-good, fun time poppy dance tunes that I can't go wrong with.  So who would blame me?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you look at albums I've listened to the most, I think it's a pretty good list.  We start with Blaqk Audio's SexCells, as mentioned before.  A couple soundtracks, including <em>Repo!  The Genetic Opera.</em> And the <strong>awesome</strong> comedy album by The Lonely Island, Incredibad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also as far as albums we have that new album by Ghostland Obervatory I mentioned, The Dance Macbre Remix album by The Faint, Daft Punk's Discovery, and Battles' Mirrored.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I've heard Battles in previous years, but it was just this year I got their album "Mirrored", and it's really great stuff.  Highly recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To close things out I'll point you to songs that I've been recommending, as they are a great example of music I've loved at that point in time.  So seriously head over to <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a05d/1355981319443/?format=original">http://gabekangas.com/musicrecommendations</a> to hear some tunes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know this post wasn't very deep or anything, but hey.  What do you expect?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Below I'll embed a few sources of tunes probably mentioned above, and you can partake if you like.  Enjoy!</p>
