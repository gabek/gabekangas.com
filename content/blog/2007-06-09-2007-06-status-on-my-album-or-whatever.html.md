So i\'ve pretty much had the freedom now for over a month to work on my music whenever I want to. There\'s a problem though, an a rather large one. I don\'t want to. There\'s just too much going on, and i\'m unable to focus on a large project like that at the present time. It\'s really bothering me. I mean, there\'s no timeline, so there\'s really no problem. It\'s my own thing, and there\'s nobody chomping at the bit to listen to this stuff. But I think it\'s good, and I really want people to hear it, I just can\'t get myself to finish it. I\'m a really different place now than I was not so long ago in so many ways, and it\'s really difficult to try to force yourself back into that mindset.

I don\'t know, I know breaks from this stuff is good from me. History has shown me that when I leave my music for a duration of time I come back to it with a clear head and I look at it differently. Generally when you work on anything for a long time you start caring about the details and not the big picture. And that\'s always true in projects i\'m involved in.

So hopefully soon I can figure out what it takes to get back in front of that desk and finish this stuff. There\'s so much to come i\'m really excited about.

See, i\'ve even started wiring things up!
