Saw Rasputina at The Abby last night. Was a good show. The set list was better the first time I saw them, but we had a good time anyway. They rocked out and everyone enjoyed it. I\'m tired today, though. Out late, up early, and i\'ll be out late tonight too because of work.

Next stop, [The Pitchfork Music Festival](http://pitchforkmusicfestival.com/) to see The New Pornographers and Of Montreal this Sunday.
