<p>So i've had two dreams recently about me getting fired from my job. Last nights was even more disturbing.</p>
<p>It included our new uber-manager from Omaha yelling at me on the phone and then bringing my case to some peer review committee to see if I should be able to keep my job or not. He said "the choice was clear" and I could no longer work for the company.</p>
<p>The one before that was with my "manager" firing me. But whatever. If he fired me i'd probably just ignore him and still come back the next day.</p>
<p>So I decided on my next tattoo. It'll be this, but in black.</p>
