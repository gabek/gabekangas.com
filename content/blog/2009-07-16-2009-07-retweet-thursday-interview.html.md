Well who would have thought?  The fine people over at [Silicon Prairie News](http://www.siliconprairienews.com) were interested in talking to me about the weirdest meme to ever hit Twitter (aside from \#MufasaMonday I suppose), [\#retweet\_thursday.](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23retweet_thursday) They told me they weren\'t sure who was behind it at first, but figured out it was out of Omaha somewhere, so they pinpointed it to me.  I never really made it public that the bot was run by me, but I wasn\'t really hiding the fact either :)

They came to me asking if I\'d be willing to tell my story about why it came about, what the deal with the [\@RT\_Thursday](http://www.twitter.com/rt_thursday){.aptureNoAutolink} account was, and how it all worked.

So take a stop over and check out the article and video interview:

And while you\'re there check out all of the other awesome posts about what\'s going on in the Omaha area.  [There\'s a great interview with Rahul Gupta that you won\'t want to miss.](http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2009/07/spn-interviews-rahul-gupta-of-dispatchthis/)
