Or so I tried. I called anyway. The people at Comcast hooked me up with a new \"deal\" that I just couldn\'t pass up, or something. I have a feeling once I get the bill it won\'t be such a deal anymore. They find ways to add on tons of stupid charges. Add on all the other taxes and we\'ll see how much better off I am. I got pissed at Comcast once and for all. My plan was to cancel cable and just download shows through the new Amazon Unbox + TiVo setup or through the [Apple TV + iTunes Store setup](http://www.apple.com/appletv/). I spent to much on my new TiVo that I figured it would work great as a media download appliance, but Amazon doesn\'t have much of selection compared to iTunes.

I\'m just trying to find ways to free myself from the companies telling me how I should be spending my money. I don\'t have enough money as it is, so it really bothers me when it goes somewhere when i\'m not convinced it\'s what I want to be spending it on. Lifetime, Oxygen, Hallmark Channel, Golf TV, ESPN, all things I don\'t want my money to go to.

So i\'ll give this new deal a shot for a month, but i\'ll probably cancel it still. I\'m willing to go without TV completely just to not have to deal with them and be a part of the empire. I\'ll pay my \$2 a week to watch LOST, another \$2 for South Park, etc.

*(\$2 \* \# of Shows) \* 4 weeks in a month \< What i\'m paying comcast*.

And freedom is priceless.
