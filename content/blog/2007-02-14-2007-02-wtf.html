<p>Seriously.  Should had stayed in bed today.
Day went fine until I decided to go home from work and Metra decided to stop all trains from leaving Chicago on my train line.</p>
<p>So a few hours later (We're talking after 9pm finally) Metra decides I can finally go home and I do.  Too bad the train station wasn't shoveled or plowed when I got off the train.</p>
<p>My car isn't anywhere near where you get off the train, it's quite the long treck.  And it it's even longer when it's in feet of snow.  I was exhausted by the time I got home.  I was ready to crash.</p>
<p>But the amount of snow waiting for me in the driveway was crazy, I couldn't even park my car legally.  So I spent another 45min or so shoveling and trying to beat off the cramps that keep popping up due to my lack of physical ability.</p>
<p>So here I am finally able to go to bed and I can't, i'm just too worked up.  That and my ear ache.</p>
