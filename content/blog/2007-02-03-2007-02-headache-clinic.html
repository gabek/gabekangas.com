<html><body><p>To go or not to go?  There's a place in chicago called the <a href="http://diamondheadache.com/">Diamond Headache Clinic</a>.  Being i've been on another bad downswing with the whole migraine thing i'm thinking I should see someone else... again.  Not that I haven't seen enough people in the past, but it hasn't helped all that much.  One thing I have got out of my neurologist is the wonderful drug of <a href="http://www.relpax.com/">Relpax</a>.  You take one when you feel it coming on, and it takes about 2hrs to kick in.  But it works almost all of the time, it really is a life saver.  Previously i'd have to stay home instead of going somewhere, now I have something that can help.  The problem is I don't have a way to prevent them from coming on, and I can only get 6 pills of Relpax at a time for insurance reasons.  I do take a pill every night, but it doesn't really seem to do anything.
I'll think about it.</p></body></html>
