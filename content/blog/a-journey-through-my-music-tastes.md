Not going to talk about the super early days where I listened to country, Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, etc.

Admittedly my music taste didn't start forming in earnest until I left High School. In High School, even though I was intensely deep in a world of musicians and performance, I didn't discover new music. We were collectively far too busy listening to the RENT soundtrack. One exception to this was Marilyn Manson. There was a guy a couple years older than I was who would wear KMFDM t-shirts and talk about Marilyn Manson. And while KMFDM was not really accessible to me in my high school years, that was the height of Marilyn Manson hysteria. So a friend and I picked up a copy of Antichrist Superstar from the mall CD store and we both fell in love with it.

Another rare High School discovery was The Prodigy's Fat of the Land. One of my friends had recently put one of those crazy 90s sound systems in his car and loved showing off the subwoofer. That was the first time I had heard The Prodigy's "Breathe".

I started going to concerts seriously when I was around 20. The first band I started going out of my way to see live was Kill Hannah. They were still a local Chicago band at the time and hadn't yet released their major label debut so they were playing a lot of shows nearby, often opening for larger touring acts. One notable one was seeing them open for Shiny Toy Guns. Shiny Toy Guns wasn't huge at the time, but they were touring. And this show they did in Chicago was horrible. To this day I don't know what the problem was, since I'm now a fan of the band and have seen them probably 5 times at this point. But they sounded bad when I was first introduced to them. The crowd was laughing.

In the early 2000s I had met somebody through work, Frank, who was blogging about music he was enjoying at [frankpayne.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20040607061730/http://www.frankpayne.com:80/html/main.php) and every day he introduced me to something new. Quintron, Har Mar Superstar, !!!, Out Hud, Ladytron, Ratatat, Adult., 8bitpeoples, Ghostland Observatory, Hella, I am the World Trade Center, and so many more that I still enjoy to this day are thanks to him. He told me about all of the upcoming Chicago shows, and I went. And that's when I really got hooked on live music. And while I couldn't really jive with The Magnetic Fields, and he didn't really understand why I was into Nine Inch Nails, in general he had a good 98% success rate with recommending music to me that to this day has not been matched. _"You know the awesome guitar solo in Daft Punk's Digital Love? Well Ratatat is entirely that."_ - Frank Payne. He now runs [techno events in Chicago](https://www.facebook.com/noisefloorchicago/), so go drop by if you're ever in Chicago.

In the late 2000s I started listening to more new mainstream Dance, House, Trance, Big Beat, Techno and stuff that might be called "Electronica". I was enjoying Moby, Ferry Corsten, BT, Tiga, Paul Oakenfold, Crystal Method, Chemical Brothers and other producers of the time. I continued to listen to new stuff that came out of the different mainstream electronic genres until well into the Dubstep fad. But it wasn't long after I was thinking "This Skrillex and deadmau5 stuff is kind of cool" before I was done with mainstream "EDM" forever and felt saddened that "electronic music" has become a dirty word because of the producers of the modern era.

- - American Recordings 1995 Sampler - [https://www.discogs.com/Various-American-Recordings-1995-CD-Sampler/release/310169](https://www.discogs.com/Various-American-Recordings-1995-CD-Sampler/release/310169)

* Hackers Soundtrack
  This is a big one. It's the first time I really heard Underworld, Carl Cox, Orbital, Stereo MC's, Leftfield, Kruder & Dorfmeister, and more.

- - Mortal Combat movie. Saw it in the theater and thought "that music is awesome!" And wanted the soundtrack. Turns out it was done by Lords of Acid guy.
- MP3s

Sometimes you listen to what you have. And in the early days of MP3s I had a completely random collection of stuff. Some old, some new, some popular, some completely underground, and I didn't really know who was who much of the time. I just downloaded it, and if I liked it I continued to listen to it.
