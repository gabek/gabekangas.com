Admittedly my music taste didn't start forming in earnest until I left High School. In High School, even though I was intensely deep in a world of musicians and performance, I didn't discover new music. We were collectively far too busy listening to the RENT soundtrack. One exception to this was Marilyn Manson. There was a guy a couple years older than I was who would wear KMFDM t-shirts and talk about Marilyn Manson. And while KMFDM was not really accessible to me in my high school years, that was the height of Marilyn Manson hysteria. So a friend and I picked up a copy of Antichrist Superstar from the mall and we both fell in love with it.

I'm a compilation success story.  So much of the music I heard the first time was on a compilation or soundtrack album.  For whatever reason compilations and soundtracks don't get enough credit.

In 1995 I went to the movie theater to see Mortal Kombat: The Motion Picture.  I left thinking "that music was awesome!".  It wasn't until years later where I went to look up who made that definitive "Mortal Kombat song" that we've all heard.  Turned out to be a band called ["The Immortals"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortals_(band)).  I had never heard of them before.  And there's a reason for that, it seems they only existed for the sole purpose of [making music for Mortal Kombat stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat:_The_Album).  And who was behind "The Immortals"?  A couple guys from Lords of Acid.  How cool.

One compilation I remember listening to a ton was the [American Recordings 1995 Sampler](https://www.discogs.com/Various-American-Recordings-1995-CD-Sampler/release/310169).  This was the first time I heard Lords of Acid, MC 900 FT Jesus, God Lives Underwater, and Love and Rockets.

But a compilation that really helped shaped me for the rest of my life was [The Hackers Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k07cflKCl-Y&list=PL6E1AC915A0204BC0).  It's the first time I heard Underworld, Carl Cox, The Prodigy, Orbital, Stereo MC's, Leftfield, Kruder & Dorfmeister, and more.  I remember the exact moment I heard "Voodoo People" for the first time.

Speaking of The Prodigy, a rare High School discovery was The Prodigy's Fat of the Land. One of my friends had recently put one of those crazy 90s sound systems in his car and loved showing off the subwoofer. That was the first time I had heard The Prodigy's "Breathe".

One compilation I ran into years later, that was my first concentrated dose of modern goth and EBM was [Graver's Paradise](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Gravers-Paradise/release/592106).  This was the first time I heard the likes of Apoptygma Berzerk, Funker Vogt, Zeromancer, The Mission UK, Gary Numan, Razed in Black, Switchblade Symphony and more.

The late 90s had a handful of pivotal albums for me.  BT's [ESCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESCM_(album)) featuring "Flaming June" was my first taste of BT.  I found Daft Punk's [Homework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homework_(Daft_Punk_album)) in a CD player of mine one day.  I have no idea who's it was, or how it got there.  We also have standouts such as Moby's [Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(Moby_album)),   And my enjoyment of Eurodance was heavily inspired by Aqua's [Aquarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium_(Aqua_album)) and Eiffel 65's [Europop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europop_(album)).

You might think that "random cd left in a CD player" thing is a weird story.  And it totally is.  And it's even weirder that it's **not the only time it happened**.  The first time I heard triphop was via a cd left of Hooverphonic's [A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Stereophonic_Sound_Spectacular).  After I got my hands on that I listened to it a ton.

I started going to concerts seriously when I was around 20. The first band I started to see live was [Kill Hannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Hannah). They were still a local Chicago band at the time and hadn't yet released their major label debut so they were playing a lot of shows nearby, often opening for larger touring acts. One notable one was seeing them open for Shiny Toy Guns. Shiny Toy Guns wasn't huge at the time, but they were touring. And this show they did in Chicago was horrible. To this day I don't know what the problem was, since I'm now a fan of the band and have seen them probably 5 times at this point. But they sounded bad when I was first introduced to them. The crowd was laughing.

In the early 2000s I had met somebody at work, Frank, who was blogging about music he was enjoying at [frankpayne.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20040607061730/http://www.frankpayne.com:80/html/main.php). Every day he introduced me to something new. Quintron, Har Mar Superstar, !!!, Out Hud, Ladytron, Ratatat, Adult., 8bitpeoples, Ghostland Observatory, Hella, I am the World Trade Center, and so many more that I still enjoy to this day are thanks to him. He told me about all of the upcoming Chicago shows, and I went. And that's when I really got hooked on live music. And while I couldn't really jive with The Magnetic Fields, and he didn't really understand why I was into Nine Inch Nails, in general he had a good 98% success rate with recommending music to me that to this day has not been matched. _"You know the awesome guitar solo in Daft Punk's Digital Love? Well Ratatat is entirely that."_ - Frank Payne. He now runs [techno events in Chicago](https://www.facebook.com/noisefloorchicago/), so go drop by if you're ever in Chicago.

In the late 2000s for a bit I started listening to more new mainstream Dance, House, Trance, Big Beat, Techno and stuff that might be called "Electronica". I was enjoying Moby, Ferry Corsten, BT, Tiga, Paul Oakenfold, Crystal Method, Chemical Brothers and other producers of the time. I continued to listen to new stuff that came out of the different mainstream electronic genres until well into the Dubstep fad. But it wasn't long after I was thinking "This new Skrillex and deadmau5 stuff is kind of cool" before I was done with mainstream "EDM" forever and felt saddened that "electronic music" has become a dirty word because of the new class of producers.

- - Mortal Combat movie. Saw it in the theater and thought "that music is awesome!" And wanted the soundtrack. Turns out it was done by Lords of Acid guy.
- MP3s

Sometimes you listen to what you have. And in the early days of MP3s I had a completely random collection of stuff. Some old, some new, some popular, some completely underground, and I didn't really know who was who much of the time. I just downloaded it, and if I liked it I continued to listen to it.

* Aqua

- BT ESCM -> Emotional Technology

- Hooverphonic a new stereo sound spectacular


- The Matrix soundtrack

* The Prodigy

* So many misc "Euro Anthems" compilations.

* Venus Hum

By 2002 I had three albums of my own under my belt that solidly made a statement that I loved electronic music that you could dance to.

Marilyn Manson - Tourniquet
