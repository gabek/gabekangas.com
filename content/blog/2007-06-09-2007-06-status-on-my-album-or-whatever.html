<p>So i've pretty much had the freedom now for over a month to work on my music whenever I want to.  There's a problem though, an a rather large one.  I don't want to.  There's just too much going on, and i'm unable to focus on a large project like that at the present time.  It's really bothering me.
I mean, there's no timeline, so there's really no problem.  It's my own thing, and there's nobody chomping at the bit to listen to this stuff.  But I think it's good, and I really want people to hear it, I just can't get myself to finish it.  I'm a really different place now than I was not so long ago in so many ways, and it's really difficult to try to force yourself back into that mindset.</p>
<p>I don't know, I know breaks from this stuff is good from me.  History has shown me that when I leave my music for a duration of time I come back to it with a clear head and I look at it differently.  Generally when you work on anything for a long time you start caring about the details and not the big picture.  And that's always true in projects i'm involved in.</p>
<p>So hopefully soon I can figure out what it takes to get back in front of that desk and finish this stuff.  There's so much to come i'm really excited about.</p>
