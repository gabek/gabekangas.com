Wow, ten years since I graduated high school.  Many probably will say \"it seems like only yesterday\" but to me it seems much, much longer.   In fact, to be honest, I hardly remember those four years at all.  Sure some special moments stand out that included performances or things with friends, but on the whole\... really, nothing. I wasn\'t planning on going to the reunion.  It wasn\'t until my friend Becky from high school asked me to go did I cave and signed up and booked a flight.  I figured the people I wanted to talk to I already have on Facebook, and the rest I don\'t remember anyway.

I kind of feel bad.  I hear my friends on Facebook mention names and I have zero recollection to who they may be.  I suppose I could dig through a year book or something before I head back to Illinois and try to recount people I may run into, but I don\'t care that much.  I have a group of about five people I\'m really looking forward to seeing.  The rest I guess never mattered enough for me to remember that they existed.

We\'re (more or less) going to stick together as a group and travel via Becky\'s mom\'s car who only has a tape deck.  I volunteered to put together a sweet mix tape that would jive with our four years we were there.  And here it is:

1.  Third Eye Blind - Semi Charmed Life 2.  Bush - Swallowed 3.  Oasis - Wonderwall 4.  The Smashing Pumpkins - Tonight, Tonight 5.  Hanson - MMMBop 6.  Goo Goo Dolls - Black Balloon 7.  Merrill Bainbridge - Mouth 8.  Meredith Brooks - Bitch 9.  Sarah McLachlan - Building a Mystery 10. Jewel - Foolish Games 11. Natalie Imbruglia - Torn 12. Cake - I Will Survive 13. Savage Garden - I Want You 14. Spice Girls - Say You\'ll Be There 15. Fool\'s Garden - Lemon Tree 16. Beck - Where It\'s At 17. Beastie Boy s- Intergalactic 18. Bloodhound Gang - The Bad Touch 19. Santana and Rob Thomas - Smooth 20. No Doubt - Sunday Morning 21. Chumbawamba - Tubthumping
