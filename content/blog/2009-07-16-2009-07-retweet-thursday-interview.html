<p>Well who would have thought?  The fine people over at <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com">Silicon Prairie News </a>were interested in talking to me about the weirdest meme to ever hit Twitter (aside from #MufasaMonday I suppose), <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23retweet_thursday">#retweet_thursday.</a>
They told me they weren't sure who was behind it at first, but figured out it was out of Omaha somewhere, so they pinpointed it to me.  I never really made it public that the bot was run by me, but I wasn't really hiding the fact either :)</p>
<p>They came to me asking if I'd be willing to tell my story about why it came about, what the deal with the <a class="aptureNoAutolink" href="http://www.twitter.com/rt_thursday">@RT_Thursday</a> account was, and how it all worked.</p>
<p>So take a stop over and check out the article and video interview:</p>

<p>And while you're there check out all of the other awesome posts about what's going on in the Omaha area.  <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2009/07/spn-interviews-rahul-gupta-of-dispatchthis/">There's a great interview with Rahul Gupta that you won't want to miss.</a></p>
