<p>Was an exciting weekend to say the least.  Friday night I went out with Jess, who's introducing me to some great people.  Saturday and Sunday I met up with Jillian who's looking for apartments and is kind enough to let me tag along.  And Saturday night I went to a coworker's party that followed the Alcohol + Fire = Burning Things rule.  <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1948788">Here's the video!</a>I have an application for one apartment, but that's it so far.  Everywhere is managed by companies that aren't open on weekends, so I'll probably get a slew of calls today and tomorrow.  I'm just not so sure I'll have time to see them all.  I put in a lot of calls, so I expect a lot of returns soon.  At the very least i'll turn in this one application for a duplex place and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Tonight i'm going to a show Jillian invited me to.  My first Omaha concert!  Cool!  I think i'm getting sick, though, so I better take care of myself.  If I have to i'll take some time off when I get home to pack and rest and get everything in order.  I think i'm a wee stressed.</p>
