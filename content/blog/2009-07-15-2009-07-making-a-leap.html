<p>I'm going to be a real ass-hat with this post, and I apologize.  I'm not going to tell any details, but instead I'm just going to type and you can be annoyed afterwards.
I've been working on a project.  And at first I thought it was going to go one direction, but then I decided to take it a different direction in my execution of it.</p>
<p>Previous projects I've worked on usually have a life cycle that includes me wanting to build something, I work a lot in all of my spare time on it, putting out a version, and then being drained from my "day job" and unable to continue to work on it anymore.  So it runs in the stable, initial state.  While getting a v1 product out the door is always a good thing, I consistently insult every idea I've ever had because things can go farther.  I'm the only limitation.</p>
<p>There's never really a "perfect time" for a lot of things, so instead I took the thoughts and feelings I have for what I'm currently doing as inspiration to take a different route.  A simple "Would you like change?  Then make choices that create change" kind of thing.  We'll see what happens.</p>
<p>I'll have something cool tomorrow to show everyone, but that has nothing to do with this stuff.</p>
