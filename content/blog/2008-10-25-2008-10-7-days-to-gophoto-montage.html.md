Seven days from today I\'ll be on my way to Omaha. A moving company is coming first thing Saturday morning to put everything on a truck and off I go. Sounds so simple.

In honor of me leaving, I put together a quick collection of some photos of random times/events/entertaining things that took place here. I have another week to make some more great memories, but here\'s a little selection so far.

[So here\'s some awesome photos.  Enjoy.](http://gallery.me.com/gabekangas#100182)
