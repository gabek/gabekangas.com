So this week marks six months of living in Omaha. I can\'t help but look back to a [simple blog post I made on August 1st, 2008](/gabes-digital-life-1/2008/08/hellooooo-omaha). I wrote \"Do I want to move to Omaha? Not really.\" Now flash forward to May 2009 where my journey in Omaha has so little to do with the reason I came here in the first place.

It\'s mostly about the people for me. From the second I stepped foot on Omaha\'s soil it\'s been a non-stop experience of meeting the greatest people ever.

-   I land in October, to visit. I immediately get a text message from
    [Jess](http://www.narcissica.com/), \"Welcome to Omaha.\" From that moment I never felt more welcome somewhere.
-   A couple days later [Jillian](http://www.myspace.com/sccrgrl2002)
    helps me find a place to live in Dundee.
-   [Boutcher](http://smellypuppy.com/) introduces me to everyone at the
    office and invites me to a party thrown by [Phil](http://www.phildietz.com).
-   I meet [Kat](http://twitter.com/geekyfemme) for coffee and I\'m glad
    to know someone who wants to talk geekery with me. She introduces me to drag queens.
-   I meet Cassie who shows me how the city likes to have fun and in
    turn I get to show her how Chicago does when we visit my friends there.
-   At my first Tweetup I introduce myself to the infamous
    [KT](http://twitter.com/k_to_the_t), who has since become a very close friend and a source of inspiration both socially and professionally.
-   [Andrea](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=63209123&ref=mf)
    becomes my partner in crime any time either of us want to go out, or there\'s a show.
-   I meet [Dusty](http://www.dustyd.net/)
    [and](http://www.siliconprairienews.com/) [Jeff](http://www.slobotski.com/) who show me that I can be a part of something in Omaha that would never be possible in Chicago.
-   Becoming friends with [Christin](http://twitter.com/incognito1027)
    makes me realize that I can share things and be important to someone else\'s life just like so many have become important to mine.
-   I learn when I go out with
    [Terah](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=63202841&ref=mf), [Bree](http://twitter.com/obrewan), and [Valerie](http://twitter.com/valerienoelle) there\'s going to be some awesome tunes played on the jukebox. We\'ll sing \"Tom Sawyer\" multiple times.
-   I become a real part of a neighborhood. Knowing if I go to \"my
    bar\", [The 49r](http://www.myspace.com/49rlounge), I\'ll see people I recognize.
-   [Krin](http://www.kandy.net/) sucks because she moved to Chicago.
    Wish she could have stuck around longer.
-   In no other world would
    [Schaft](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1545495035&ref=mf), otherwise just \"the bartender\", be a friend of mine outside of a pint of Boulevard.
-   I can walk to \"my coffee shop\" and see that
    [Megan](http://www.princesslasertron.com/) is just down the street.  I can go say hi and [share some ice cream and conversation](http://twitter.com/lasertron/status/1689301321).
-   [Brian](http://twitter.com/bspersonal) shows me how fun and awkward
    it could be for a few guys who have no clue what they\'re doing to [throw themselves into the public promotions game](http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2601/128/113/690609344/n690609344_1441636_7322896.jpg).
-   [Dave](http://twitter.com/daveloyall) and
    [Matt](http://twitter.com/secos) help me debug issues with my web site on IRC. The difference here is I know I\'ll see them in a couple days and I\'ll buy them a beer to thank them.
-   [BigOmaha](http://www.bigomaha.com)

There\'s so many other people, places, and experiences that I\'m missing. But this isn\'t meant to be some kind of all encompassing list of everyone that I know. Just a snapshot of some really important people that have made the six months probably the best six months of my life.

Thanks, Omaha.
