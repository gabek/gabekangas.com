<p>So I thought I had the crap with my car dealt with, as Kelley is demanding to be removed from my auto loan. Now I just got an email:</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we cannot refinance for you based on the information you provided because you applied by yourself and we cannot remove anyone from loans or titles. In other words, the names that are on your current loan/lease now are the names it must stay in for us to do the refinance."</p>
<p>Wtf! I thought that was the point of a refinance is to get evil ex-wives off your loan. I thought this was going to be taken care of.</p>
<p>Guess she'll be taking me to court. But it's not my fault it's not legally possible to do what she wants done.</p>
<p>I hate her with the fire of one hundred dragons.</p>
