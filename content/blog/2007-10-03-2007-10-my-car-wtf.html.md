So i\'m not going to go too deep into the story right now. But my car has been towed by the city of Chicago because someone stole the license plate off it, and my iPod is missing from it. I\'m the victim of a crime and was ticketed \$500 for it. I have to pay that before I can get my car back. Details to come.
