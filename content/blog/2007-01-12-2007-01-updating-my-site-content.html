<p>Just a quick update.  I'm removing a few things from my web site here.  First of all, removing any posts from my myspace blog... I deleted my myspace.com account.  Second, digg.com Diggs.  I found I wasn't digging stories just because I didn't want to flood my web page with things that probably aren't interesting.  And last, my Podshow.com blog, because I hate podshow and don't use it anyway.
So no loss, eh?</p>
<p>BTW, that PC World with PandoraFM is the February edition, so go get it.</p>
