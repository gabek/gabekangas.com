This is the first time I did a public live stream on The Bat Station.  A handful of people tuned in and it was pretty cool.  I figured if it all fell apart I could just not share the recording, but it turned out ok.

I'm still not great a this whole mixing thing, but I'm getting better, and it's fun to share this new hobby and show you all my progress!

This time I wanted to only do a mix with songs I've purchased directly, and not using any streaming services.  It has a fun mix of harder EBM feeling stuff, some more minimal techno and some psytrance jams.
