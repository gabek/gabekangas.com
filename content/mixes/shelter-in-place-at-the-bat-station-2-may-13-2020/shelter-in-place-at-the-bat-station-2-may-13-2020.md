title: 'Shelter in Place at The Bat Station #2'
description: May 13, 2020.  Another live stream mix on The Bat Station!  This was
  my first time doing a mix using Rekordbox, so I’m a little rusty with it.  I tried
  to be a little more creative in chopping things up in real-time that caters to my
  inner musician tendencies.  It’s cool to treat DJ hardware as an instrument.  I
  had fun, and I hope you enjoy the music I picked out.

May 13, 2020.  Another live stream mix on The Bat Station!  This was my first time doing a mix using Rekordbox, so I’m a little rusty with it.  I tried to be a little more creative in chopping things up in real-time that caters to my inner musician tendencies.  It’s cool to treat DJ hardware as an instrument.  I had fun, and I hope you enjoy the music I picked out.

As a side note, I'm generating the track list from the Cue file that Rekordbox exports when saving a recording of a set.  It's not terribly accurate because it's the time that I load a track, not the time that you hear the track.  So if you seek exactly to the timestamp you're probably not going to hear what you're looking for, but at some point after that location the song should get mixed in.
