summary: On July 7th, 2020 I did a live video stream to test Owncast.  This is the audio recording from that video.  It was cool to have people drop by, listen to some music, and help test out the server.  I really appreciate the time anybody spends to help me test things, since when it comes to things like Owncast it needs to be used to be tested.  And people need to tune in for me to get any useful data out of it.

On July 7th, 2020 I did a live video stream to test [Owncast](/blog/2020/06/owncast-a-project-to-take-control-over-your-own-live-streaming/).  This is the audio recording from that video.

It was cool to have people drop by, listen to some music, and help test out the server.  I really appreciate the time anybody spends to help me test things, since when it comes to things like Owncast it needs to be used to be tested.  And people need to tune in for me to get any useful data out of it.

Apple II monitor photo was taken by https://mastodon.social/@pizza_pal.  Thatâ€™s how he watched the stream.  So cool.
