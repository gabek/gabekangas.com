# Lost and Found: A video experiment started in 2006

In 2006 I was diligently working on my (still unreleased) new album \"The Longest Post\". With that I decided to create a couple music videos both as an experiment on if I could make something fun, and to have a visual way to distribute some songs. A couple apartment moves later and the hard drives with the music videos were lost.

Until now. In October, 2010 I found the hard drives while cleaning out my music studio and decided it was time to show them to the world.

They weren\'t completely finished, however. But a couple nights of some polish and fixes made it so the first, \"Got Skillz?\" could be released. And here it is.

Some things of note: You can tell it\'s from 2007. Old school web pages and apps. You see an old version of YouTube complete with a greasemonkey script changing the background color of it running within an old version of Firefox.  I was running a lot more extensions then than I remember.

Also given the lack of resources as far as what video I had to work with I experimented with using the game/app/world of \"Second Life\" for some of the character stuff to emulate the \"party in the computer\" vibe.

The video \"Got Skillz?\" tells the story of the party inside the computer. The song says \"Get off the floor, and get on the net. The dance you see there is unbelievable I bet.\" and the video shows it to be true.

It also mocks the world of rap music by itself being a rap song, but showing how the character of Real-ity doesn\'t belong in the ghetto with the homies and would probably just find the nearest computer and get online.

See below for a \"behind the scenes\" video from when I was working on this originally (February 2007).
