Create the soundtrack of your year.

Now THIS is more like it!  Though to be honest I feel like I talk about music to people so often I don\'t know what to put here that\'s worth reading.

It\'s actually pretty easy for me to find what I\'ve been listening to this past year because of Last.FM.  => http://www.last.fm/user/Gabek/charts?rangetype=year&subtype=artists In fact here is my 12 month chart in detail. However, this year I haven\'t really been \"into\" anything significantly like most years.  It\'s certainly been a soundtrack of a year built of previous years and a couple new discoveries.  But unlike years where I can say \"I was really into Daft Punk\" or \"I discovered the new pornographers this year\" this year has been a pretty casual listening time.

Of course Nine Inch Nails has been a staple, but there\'s nothing new there.  Though I really enjoy any live releases that happen to come out from shows, so there\'s generally always been something new to listen to.

Ghostland Observatory came out with a new album this year, \"Codename: Rondo\" and I\'ve given that a few e-rotations.  They ended up pretty high in my list with 119 plays.

Crystal Castles also came out with a new release this year, and I\'ve played them a bit.  Well, only 85 times.

I went to see Lords of Acid this year, and around that time I was playing them quite a bit.

Blaqk Audio is an electronic dancey group that I never would have heard of if \@andrea\_joi didn\'t suggest them to me.  They get a pretty constant play rate in my rotation.

If you organize my music

=> http://www.last.fm/user/Gabek/charts?rangetype=year&subtype=tracks by what tracks I listened to the most

 it gets even a little more broad.  Is that Semisonic\'s 2001 hit \"Chemistry\" way up on the charts?  Yes it is.  And that, my friends, shows you that it\'s been kind of a down year when it comes to tunes for me.  (Don\'t get me wrong, I really like that song.)

For some reason \"Shiny Toy Guns\" was a staple this year as well.  But that\'s some feel-good, fun time poppy dance tunes that I can\'t go wrong with.  So who would blame me?

If you look at albums I\'ve listened to the most, I think it\'s a pretty good list.  We start with Blaqk Audio\'s SexCells, as mentioned before.   A couple soundtracks, including Repo!  The Genetic Opera. And the *awesome* comedy album by The Lonely Island, Incredibad.

Also as far as albums we have that new album by Ghostland Obervatory I mentioned, The Dance Macbre Remix album by The Faint, Daft Punk\'s Discovery, and Battles\' Mirrored.

I\'ve heard Battles in previous years, but it was just this year I got their album \"Mirrored\", and it\'s really great stuff.  Highly recommended.

To close things out I\'ll point you to songs that I\'ve been recommending, as they are a great example of music I\'ve loved at that point in time.  So seriously head over to
