It\'s really your last chance right now to get tickets.

I\'d really love to try and convince you to go, but at this point, if this is your kind of thing\... you\'re already not willing to miss it.  However, if you\'re out of town, out of state\... whatever, this is a GREAT chance to visit the amazing city of Omaha. Seriously. Get a ticket, and get your ass here. Omaha is going to be the center of the creative world for two days and I would hate for anyone to miss it.  Unfortunately, many will.

So I\'m not going to get on my soap box and tell you why you should go or what great things are going to come out of it.  I\'m only going to tell you that if you\'re at all interested, and you don\'t go, you\'re going to feel really left out.  That\'s all.

So hit up

 and hurry to get your ticket before they\'re all sold out.  Exciting stuff, people.  Some socks will be rocked.
