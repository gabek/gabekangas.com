<p>I meant to put this together weeks ago, but I guess things got in the way.  But Windows 7 is released only once in a lifetime, so I couldn't just forget about it.
Earlier this month @shinyhat threw a Microsoft sanctioned Windows 7 launch party and he invited me along for the ride.  It had all of the stuff that Microsoft sent him.  Posters, streamers, playing cards, poker chips, a puzzle, and even a Microsoft trivia game.</p>
<p>It was just as Windowstastic as I could ever expect.  From the logo colored front windows to the custom "7" on the wall the guy really went all out.  We even had 7-layer dip.</p>
<p>It was mostly a group of Apple fans there, so we discussed failed Zune installs, Windows blue screens, and other typical Microsoft faire.  Best Windows party ever.</p>
<p>Some day you can tell your kids you knew someone who went to a real Windows 7 launch party.  Note the cameo by @programmerman as well.  Enjoy.</p>
