<p>Wow, ten years since I graduated high school.  Many probably will say "it seems like only yesterday" but to me it seems much, much longer.  In fact, to be honest, I hardly remember those four years at all.  Sure some special moments stand out that included performances or things with friends, but on the whole... really, nothing.
I wasn't planning on going to the reunion.  It wasn't until my friend Becky from high school asked me to go did I cave and signed up and booked a flight.  I figured the people I wanted to talk to I already have on Facebook, and the rest I don't remember anyway.</p>
<p>I kind of feel bad.  I hear my friends on Facebook mention names and I have zero recollection to who they may be.  I suppose I could dig through a year book or something before I head back to Illinois and try to recount people I may run into, but I don't care that much.  I have a group of about five people I'm really looking forward to seeing.  The rest I guess never mattered enough for me to remember that they existed.</p>
<p>We're (more or less) going to stick together as a group and travel via Becky's mom's car who only has a tape deck.  I volunteered to put together a sweet mix tape that would jive with our four years we were there.  And here it is:</p>
