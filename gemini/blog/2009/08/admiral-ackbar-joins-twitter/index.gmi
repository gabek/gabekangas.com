<p>Per recommendation of @EternalCow I built a bot that puts a much needed appearance of Admiral Ackbar (@AdmiralAckbar_) on Twitter.  He's warning (as he should be) to all who will listen that "It's a trap!"
This is funny, but the most entertaining part is the fact that people are replying back.</p>
<p>See below for a real time update of responses to "It's a trap!"</p>

<p>I'll soon have itsatrap.org up :P</p>
