# Breaking news: Big Omaha proves how awesome Gabe is

Big Omaha is a success.  No doubt.  The friendships that were built, the inspiration that filled multiple venues.  It\'s a story that will be retold many times for the next year.  But the real story took place online yesterday, when it was discussed how really awesome I am. Names hidden to protect the innocent.
