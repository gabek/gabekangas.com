# Six months of being an Omahan ( #bigomaha )

So this week marks six months of living in Omaha. I can\'t help but look back to a

. I wrote \"Do I want to move to Omaha? Not really.\" Now flash forward to May 2009 where my journey in Omaha has so little to do with the reason I came here in the first place.

It\'s mostly about the people for me. From the second I stepped foot on Omaha\'s soil it\'s been a non-stop experience of meeting the greatest people ever.

-   I land in October, to visit. I immediately get a text message from

    to know someone who wants to talk geekery with me. She introduces me to drag queens.

    turn I get to show her how Chicago does when we visit my friends there.

There\'s so many other people, places, and experiences that I\'m missing. But this isn\'t meant to be some kind of all encompassing list of everyone that I know. Just a snapshot of some really important people that have made the six months probably the best six months of my life.

Thanks, Omaha.
