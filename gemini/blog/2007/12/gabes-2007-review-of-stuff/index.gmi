<p>I do this every year. This one is a bit smaller than previous ones, and I try not to duplicate too much from things I've already talked about. Regardless, here is my review of things and stuff involved with me in 2007. I'd love to go through and hyperlink all these things for you, but it's really a lot of work, and I'm lazy. So if you're at all interested, and you probably aren't, just go ahead and google it.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 30.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #545454">I've come across a ton of great apps this year that run on my Mac.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 30.0px; text-indent: -30.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"><span style="font: 13.0px AppleGothic; color: #555555">▼</span> MoodBlast</p>

It's also scriptable. So I wrote an applescript that's triggered by <b>MarcoPolo</b> to auto update when I move around to/from work.</p>

So I don't. I've disabled icons on my OS X desktop completely. However the folder named "Desktop" is still my dropbox for all my crap. Let me introduce you to Hazel. I create rules and hazel moves stuff around for me. Sorts them into subfolders, adds to iPhoto or iTunes, deletes old files, archives to an external drive.. anything I want. This makes my life sooo much easier to find stuff. If I just downloaded a video I know exactly where to find it because I know Hazel will move it there.</p>

It's like Trent Reznor said "Gabe really likes NIN, but what would make him like it more? Oh yeah, more drum machines and synths." He did, and now I do. I won't even go into the awesome ARG that he had around the release, and the remix album, and the downloadable master tracks...</p>

It's faster and easier than dealing with torrents, but they don't have everything. It usually works like so: if it's the day of airing, i'll get it via torrents. It's brand new and it should download quick. If I can't find it on torrents, i'll get it on iTunes, or if I can't get it fast enough via a torrent it's off to iTunes. Often times I just don't feel like playing the torrent game and i'll get it from iTunes right when I see it up.</p>
