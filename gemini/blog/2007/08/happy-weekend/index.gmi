# Happy Weekend

So I told myself two weeks ago this weekend would be dedicated to getting my butt in gear and sitting down in front of the console and starting where I left off with my album. I don\'t know, though. We\'ll see. I really have to clean my apartment and do laundry first. But even if this weekend isn\'t the weekend that I get back on track the good news is that I WANT to. Finally. I want to get to work again, and that\'s a nice feeling. It\'s been a long time since I cared. I\'m excited. I can\'t wait to share my work with everyone. My goal is to have the album finished in time for some kind of Lazer Day celebration in November. I seriously don\'t think that\'s possible. But all I can do is try, right?

Laundry laundry laundry. It\'s been a couple weeks since I performed this task.

This !!! (chk chk chk) album is good.
