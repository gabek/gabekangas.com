<p>So I told myself two weeks ago this weekend would be dedicated to getting my butt in gear and sitting down in front of the console and starting where I left off with my album.  I don't know, though.  We'll see.  I really have to clean my apartment and do laundry first.  But even if this weekend isn't the weekend that I get back on track the good news is that I WANT to.  Finally.  I want to get to work again, and that's a nice feeling.  It's been a long time since I cared.  I'm excited.  I can't wait to share my work with everyone.
My goal is to have the album finished in time for some kind of Lazer Day celebration in November.  I seriously don't think that's possible.  But all I can do is try, right?</p>
<p>Laundry laundry laundry.  It's been a couple weeks since I performed this task.</p>
