<p>Crazy. It's been over a year since PandoraFM v3 was released, and I haven't really touched it at all since then. And it still works, and people still use it.</p>
<p>This fact clicked today when I ran into a post on a tech site about someone discovering it for the first time and thought it rocked. Here I am thinking it's 10min from death, and someone else thinks it's a brand new rockin site.</p>
<p>"Over 2,991,000 other tracks have been submitted to Last.FM profiles through PandoraFM."</p>
<p>Big number.</p>
