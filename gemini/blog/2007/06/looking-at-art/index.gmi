<p>So i'm looking at stuff to throw on the walls.  I bookmarked a few things on my apartment list at <a href="http://del.icio.us/gabek/apartment">http://del.icio.us/gabek/apartment</a>.  My favorite is a big black circle for over $260.  It's so pretentious.  I love it.  I'll be that guy.
I have two more Matrix posters to hang, but they're so large, i'm not so sure i'm going to use them.  They're so cool, though.  Maybe i'll put one in my bedroom.</p>
<p>I watched Episode 2 of Heroes last night.  I'm not sure if I like the show yet or not.  It's not gripping.  I could watch episode after episode if I wanted to, but I'm not.  Unlike LOST where when an episode ends you're left hanging and you'd do anything to see the next, with Heroes i'm fine that it's ended and I close the player instead of grabbing the next to see what happens.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Stay r33t.</p>
