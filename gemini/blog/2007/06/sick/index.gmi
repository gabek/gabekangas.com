# Sick

Argh. I hate when I get sick, it never goes away. I got sick this weekend and it\'ll be here to stay for a while. It\'s the standard \"i think it\'s a cold\" but really I know it\'s a sinus infection, because that\'s what I get. It\'s a sore throat because of all the crap falling from my sinuses as a post-nasal drip, and when I blow my nose I get equal part nose crap and blood crap. Yes, it\'s a sinus infection. If I make myself go to the doctor and get antibiotics it will go away. If I don\'t, it will stay\... indefinitely, until I go to the doctor. In other news, at noon Central time Steve Jobs will kick off this years WWDC with a bang as usual with his Stevenote and tell us what we all need. Some things to look for.
