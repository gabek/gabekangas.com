# Happy Friday, Friends

I had a good birthday. Went to Pepes and had Tacos. Drank some Margar33tas. Played Super Mario Brothers 3, and drank some beer. I can\'t really ask for more than that.

I got my furniture in. Even with more crap, my apartment still looks empty. Argh. I try so hard. At least I have a dining room table and coffee table and some chairs now. No more eating pizza off the floor.  I\'m looking at a new slipcover for my couch, since the old one was all full of cat hair, so I washed it, and now it won\'t fit. I washed it in cold water, but it\'s still messed up.  <http://www.bemz.com/products/2/3/17/0/24/front/> those people have some cool ones. I\'ll probably just get another plain black one to match my decor.

I put up some shelves this past week, so that helped too. More stuff off the floor. And I started to put my audio equipment together. I booted up the PC and loaded up some files. A HUGE sigh of relief from me when it all worked. I\'ve feared for the day I turned it on, because I was really afraid that It wasn\'t going to after all the transit. It was moved a few times, and I honestly do not know what i\'d do if I lost the data on that drive. I know, I know, backups. But it\'s not just the files. It\'s the whole environment that\'s important. All the plugins and programs and everything. A reinstall and copying back of the data files wouldn\'t work. I had planned on cloning the drive with Ghost previously, but then \"The Potting Soil\"
incident happened and I ran out of time and had to get that computer out of the house.

Well, it\'s Friday ladies and gentlemen. I hope you have a good weekend.  I\'m going to a party with Lauren on Saturday for one of her friends that got married, so that should be fun.

Stay r33t, j\'all.
