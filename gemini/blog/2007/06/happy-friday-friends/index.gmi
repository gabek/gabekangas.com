<p>I had a good birthday.  Went to Pepes and had Tacos.  Drank some Margar33tas.  Played Super Mario Brothers 3, and drank some beer.  I can't really ask for more than that.

<p>I got my furniture in.  Even with more crap, my apartment still looks empty.  Argh.  I try so hard.  At least I have a dining room table and coffee table and some chairs now.  No more eating pizza off the floor.  I'm looking at a new slipcover for my couch, since the old one was all full of cat hair, so I washed it, and now it won't fit.  I washed it in cold water, but it's still messed up.  <a href="http://www.bemz.com/products/2/3/17/0/24/front/">http://www.bemz.com/products/2/3/17/0/24/front/</a> those people have some cool ones.  I'll probably just get another plain black one to match my decor.  </p>
<p>I put up some shelves this past week, so that helped too.  More stuff off the floor.  And I started to put my audio equipment together.  I booted up the PC and loaded up some files.  A HUGE sigh of relief from me when it all worked.  I've feared for the day I turned it on, because I was really afraid that It wasn't going to after all the transit.  It was moved a few times, and I honestly do not know what i'd do if I lost the data on that drive.  I know, I know, backups.  But it's not just the files.  It's the whole environment that's important.  All the plugins and programs and everything.  A reinstall and copying back of the data files wouldn't work.  I had planned on cloning the drive with Ghost previously, but then "The Potting Soil" incident happened and I ran out of time and had to get that computer out of the house.</p>
<p>Well, it's Friday ladies and gentlemen.  I hope you have a good weekend.  I'm going to a party with Lauren on Saturday for one of her friends that got married, so that should be fun.</p>
<p>Stay r33t, j'all.</p>
