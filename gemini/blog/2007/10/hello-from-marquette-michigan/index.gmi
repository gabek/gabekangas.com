<p>I made it up to the UP in one piece. My car didn't disappear or anything. I have about 30min or so until I have to be at my aunt's for my grandparent's 60th anniversary party. But I decided to drive around and see if I could find somewhere with wifi.</p>
<p>I found a Starbucks and knew that would be a good start.</p>
<p>I walk in, "Excuse me, do you have wifi?" they respond "Yes we do. Well, we don't, but someone else around here does. And the signal reaches in here."</p>
<p>Good enough for me.</p>
<p>So I know where to go if I have time later to get back online. I miss the internet. My treo desn't even work up here :(</p>
<p>Ok, talk to everyone later</p>
