# What a weekend

I should go to bed, but I thought i\'d post quick. It was an awesome weekend. Photos are up from Lauren, Mary and I going to Kinetic Playground Saturday night. And Mary and I went to The PItchfork Music Festival today. Now I have to try and pretend to be normal again and go back to work in the morning :P
