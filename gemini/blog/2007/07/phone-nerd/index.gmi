<p>I haven't done a little project for a while.  I've been slacking.  So I started one last night.
I realized I never use my Vonage line.  At all.  It's really a complete waste of money.  I used 0 min out of 500 last month.  How very sad.  Even though I like the features, I never use it.</p>
<p>So yesterday I decided to read up and learn about Asterisk, an open-source software PBX system.  I signed up to a Voip provider and got a local number.  When that number is dialed the provider makes a SIP call to my PBX and the call is answered over IP.  Once Asterisk answers that call I can do anything I want.  Forward to my cell, have a menu, voicemail, etc.</p>
<p>At this point i've got Asterisk to actually answer the call, so that's a win.  I've also been able to leave a voicemail for an extension.  Now I have to learn about forwarding calls elsewhere.</p>
