# The useless and useful

So i\'m picky with things sometimes. For instance, on my desktop I like having little widgets. However, I can never seem to find exactly what I want. It\'s easy to find something that gives me the weather. It\'s impossible to find something that gives it in fahrenheit and celsius, not to mention in multiple locations at once. It\'s easy to find a little applet that shows that I have a wireless signal. It\'s not so easy to find something that displays current IP addresses.

So when I ran into

, a application made to put plain text on your desktop it clicked for me.  I\'ll write my own. It\'s generally the only way I get what I want, anyway.

Now I have good old fashioned plain text displaying the stuff I want on my desktop, and I can continue on from here if I think of other ideas.

Behold.
