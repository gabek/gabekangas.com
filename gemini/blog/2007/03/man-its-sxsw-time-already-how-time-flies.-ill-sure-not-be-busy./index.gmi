# Man, it's SXSW time already?  How time flies.  I'll sure not be busy.

It\'s been a whole year already since I hadn\'t gone to SXSW 2006 and it\'s time again for me to not go to SXSW 2007. I don\'t have my hotel all booked and my flights are not ready to go. I won\'t be arriving in Austin tonight.

I\'m really pumped about the panels that are scheduled, I can\'t wait to not see them.

Did you see the lineups of the bands? It\'s going to not be like my own personal woodstock, i\'m pumped. I\'ll probably not meet up with Robert Scoble tonight after no drinks with Mark Cuban to discuss no business ventures. I\'d tell you the details, but there are none.

Anyone else excited about the keynote by Pete Townshend? The Pete Townshend? I am! I won\'t be there with bells on. I might even not live blog it.

Phil Terrone is doing a Keynote on the 11th. Phil did the first podcast I ever heard, and is possibly the reason I listened to the second. It\'s quite symbolic for me to not get a chance to meet him.

So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to South by Southwest 2007. I hope you enjoy it as much as i\'m not going to.
