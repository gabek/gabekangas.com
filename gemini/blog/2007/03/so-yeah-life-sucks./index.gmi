<p>Kelley got in an accident the other day, the van is wrecked, but she's ok.  So we're on one car.  It sucks having to try and sync our schedules so I can be picked up, but we're doing our best.
Kelley's dad is in the hospital.  Heart and respiratory failure or something.  He was knocked out pretty good last night.</p>
<p>And things continue to go downhill.</p>
