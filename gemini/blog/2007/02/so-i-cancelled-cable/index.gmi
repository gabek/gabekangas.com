# So I cancelled cable

<p>Or so I tried.  I called anyway.  The people at Comcast hooked me up with a new "deal" that I just couldn't pass up, or something.  I have a feeling once I get the bill it won't be such a deal anymore.  They find ways to add on tons of stupid charges.  Add on all the other taxes and we'll see how much better off I am.
I got pissed at Comcast once and for all.  My plan was to cancel cable and just download shows through the new Amazon Unbox + TiVo setup or through the <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV + iTunes Store setup</a>.  I spent to much on my new TiVo that I figured it would work great as a media download appliance, but Amazon doesn't have much of selection compared to iTunes.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to find ways to free myself from the companies telling me how I should be spending my money.  I don't have enough money as it is, so it really bothers me when it goes somewhere when i'm not convinced it's what I want to be spending it on.  Lifetime, Oxygen, Hallmark Channel, Golf TV, ESPN, all things I don't want my money to go to.</p>
<p>So i'll give this new deal a shot for a month, but i'll probably cancel it still.  I'm willing to go without TV completely just to not have to deal with them and be a part of the empire.  I'll pay my $2 a week to watch LOST, another $2 for South Park, etc.  </p>
<p><em>($2  # of Shows)  4 weeks in a month &lt; What i'm paying comcast</em>.</p>
<p>And freedom is priceless.</p>
