<p>Low ain't low.  It can go, lower than you know.Look inside and it won't show, what happened long ago.
Optimists are just a lie.
An option is to die.
On my cross I'm crucified.</p>
<p>Do you know where to go?
Then why don't you show if you know?
Do you know how to get there?
Do you know where to go?</p>

Fuck me and my self prophesizing lyrics.
The lyrics I wrote for my new album are crazy messed up.  I wrote them having no idea my wife was going to divorce me.  But the songs somehow knew.  I swear they did.</p>
