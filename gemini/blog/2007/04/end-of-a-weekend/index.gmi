# End of a weekend

Kelley stayed at a co-worker\'s house to play with their kids Saturday night. I missed having her at home. But today she came home, I got Kelley and I dinner, we were watching tv. I thought we were really enjoying each other\'s company, and it was nice not to be stressed out for a while. After a show, she mentioned she was going up to take a shower. She stopped on the way up to say something really mean. \"Don\'t you love the cats? Oh, it doesn\'t matter what you think anymore. It doesn\'t matter.\" And then walked away. It really hurt.

She went to take her shower, and I went on my computer upstairs. She came out and I noticed her packing her bags and getting dressed to go out. I asked her what\'s going on, and where she\'s going. She just kept saying \"I need to go.\" I asked if anything was wrong, she said \"No, well yes\" and just pushed past me, shoving things in a bag as she walked. I asked when she\'d be back, I asked again what was going on, and she just walked out the door.

I don\'t know what to do. I love her so much. That\'s my wife. She\'s my girl, and she\'s literally walking out of my life.
