<p>So last weekend when I last blogged I met up with Katie, Tracy, Michelle and Frank. We had a blast! This Friday night we hope to go out and be all stupid again. In fact, a friend of Frank's (ex-girlfriend's sister actually) is from Omaha, and is in town. So she's going to go out with us. I have so many awesome resources for this move, I can't complain one bit. Tracy has been a huge help as well, helping me map out the different areas I should be looking for apartments next week.
Oh yeah, got all my travel information for next week. Flights, rental car, hotel. How very official. I'm excited for my trip, but nervous. I don't know what to expect.</p>
<p>Last night (I use night lightly, it was also morning) I visited Sean at Old Town Tatu to execute my Illinois tattoo. I sent him some design ideas earlier in the week, and he was excited about the idea. And holy shit, did it come out awesome. I love his work, and I couldn't be happier. However, i'm pretty tired. I didn't get out of there until after 3am.</p>
<p>Check it out, yo.</p>
