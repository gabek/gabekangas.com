# Good morning, Omaha

Was an exciting weekend to say the least.  Friday night I went out with Jess, who\'s introducing me to some great people.  Saturday and Sunday I met up with Jillian who\'s looking for apartments and is kind enough to let me tag along.  And Saturday night I went to a coworker\'s party that followed the Alcohol + Fire = Burning Things rule.

I have an application for one apartment, but that\'s it so far.  Everywhere is managed by companies that aren\'t open on weekends, so I\'ll probably get a slew of calls today and tomorrow.  I\'m just not so sure I\'ll have time to see them all.  I put in a lot of calls, so I expect a lot of returns soon.  At the very least i\'ll turn in this one
application for a duplex place and hope for the best.

Tonight i\'m going to a show Jillian invited me to.  My first Omaha concert!  Cool!  I think i\'m getting sick, though, so I better take care of myself.  If I have to i\'ll take some time off when I get home to pack and rest and get everything in order.  I think i\'m a wee stressed.
