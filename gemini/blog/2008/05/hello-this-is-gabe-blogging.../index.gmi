<html><body><p>Hello this is Gabe blogging from the car using jott.com.  I am just speaking into my phone and hopefully jott is transcribing what I am saying properly.  I just ____ to send a twitter a few minutes ago ____ somebody's name which makes me look really stupid, that's okay, so yeah I am  going to meet this person that jott does know the name of ____ my guess is that probably do something after that because the night is young and it is a Friday night. <a href="http://www.jott.com/show.aspx?id=26b76c63-3aa7-4fa4-8b47-34117e21f731" target="_blank">listen</a>
