# Just a little frustrated

Just in the past two days two people announced they are leaving the company. Why does that bother me? Because I\'m not one of them.

I\'m just so frustrated. I try so hard here. I really do. I\'m good at what I do and I think i\'m seen as an important asset. But management is just turning this place into a fucking zoo.

I never told you about the SOCOM initiative. Where you\'re in a rotation of people who sit in front of three monitors and do nothing but watch how high the numbers go. If it gets too high, you lets someone know. Or the new and improved version of it, where you also have to do it over the weekend. In front of a computer\... on the weekend\... watching numbers. I can\'t make this shit up. I\'m totally serious.

My team, the infrastructure, platform engineering team, has been turned into a client support team. And I just can\'t take it anymore. I don\'t care about clients. I don\'t. Not a bit. If they all left.. I wouldn\'t care. I care about the environment, and how to make it better. Not how happy some suit in California is. That\'s someone else\'s job.

I\'m just really upset with this place. I\'m trying my best to make my opinions known, but management here doesn\'t get it. They just don\'t.
