# What I don't want in a girl

So my buddy Joe at work sent me a link to The Lincoln Park Chad Society web page today. This is the best thing ever. Now no longer do I have to try and explain to people what I would like to see in a girl that i\'d want to date. Instead, I can just show them this\... what I *don\'t* want to have in a girl!

Amanda is a 25 year-old marketing manager for a major firm in downtown Chicago. She resides around the quaint intersection of Sheffield and Webster in the Village.
