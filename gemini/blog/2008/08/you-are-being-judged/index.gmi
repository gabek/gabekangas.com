# You are being judged

Does anyone else get these things from Facebook \"Compare People\"?  It\'s always interesting how you\'re ranked compared to others. Here\'s my current standings:

\#1 craziest (gained 1 place)\ \#2 person with the best taste in music (gained 1 place)\ \#3 nicest (gained 1 place)\ \#5 best room-mate (gained 1 place)\ \#6 most entertaining (gained 1 place)

Best room-mate? Really? I\'d be the worst. I\'ve only lived with one person before, and it ended awful. We accidently got married one time.
