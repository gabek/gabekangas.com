# Odd IRC dream

So I had a dream last night I was on CabinDuDe, the bot of \#thecabin\'s party line. And then people I\'ve been working with from Omaha at work also joined. We were using it for a chat for work. And then madcow joined and started listening in. It was a pretty crazy dream. I generally don\'t remember my dreams, but for some reason the past couple nights I have. Odd.
