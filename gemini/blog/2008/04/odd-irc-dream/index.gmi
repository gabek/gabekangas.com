<html><body><p>So I had a dream last night I was on CabinDuDe, the bot of #thecabin's party line.  And then people I've been working with from Omaha at work also joined.  We were using it for a chat for work.  And then madcow joined and started listening in.  It was a pretty crazy dream.
I generally don't remember my dreams, but for some reason the past couple nights I have.  Odd.</p></body></html>
