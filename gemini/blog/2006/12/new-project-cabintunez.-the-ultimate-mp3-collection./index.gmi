# New project: CabinTunez.  The ultimate mp3 collection.

Been working with Bob the past few days on a new Cabin project. I started the framework a while back but never did much with it.  Unfortunately, this is all private, so I can\'t really share it. But I can give you a screenshot and make you wish you had access to CabinTunez, the ultimate mp3 collection.
