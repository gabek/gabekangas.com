<p>Been working with Bob the past few days on a new Cabin project.  I started the framework a while back but never did much with it.  Unfortunately, this is all private, so I can't really share it.  But I can give you a screenshot and make you wish you had access to CabinTunez, the ultimate mp3 collection.</p>
