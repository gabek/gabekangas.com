<p>Well, they're days off for me, anyway.
I've been off so far this week, and this is my last day off.  Wanted to blow some vacation days before I lose them.  Wish I could carry some over, but I can't.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Been spending most of the time on music.  Most of it really sucks, so I find myself wanting to spend more and more time making it not suck.  I'm generally unsuccessful.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of things going on in a handful of songs, so I think i'm getting somewhere.</p>
<p>Beck said before releasing his most recent album that new releases from artists should combine not only the audio of a new CD, but videos, mashups, remixes, and the ability to customize the experience to the user.  I agree with all of that.  Even though I don't think DJ Tiesto will be knocking on my door anytime soon to do a remix to any of my tracks, there are communities online that enjoy remixing other people's work.  I'll see if I can get involved.  Plus I hope to have some music videos ready when the music is done.  I'd love to have other people involved in that too, but it takes a lot of time.</p>
<p>New YouTube video of my antics behind the mixer went up last night.  Enjoy.</p>
<p>So that's that.  Back to work!</p>
