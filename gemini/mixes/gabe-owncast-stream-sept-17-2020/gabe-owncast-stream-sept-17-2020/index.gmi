We all got together to listen to some music and hang out while testing the next release of Owncast last night.  

I had a blast, and it seems like everyone else did too.  This continuted tradition of getting together to hang out on a live stream to beta test is really pretty great.  Everyone enjoys themselves, we get feedback about Owncast, and it exercises the work that's been done on the software.

I also captured a little clip of video, because why not.  OBS has a record button, so I might as well press it.
