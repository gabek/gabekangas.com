One playlist to rule them all.</a></h1></header><p>&lt;p>The discussion of smart playlists in iTunes came up in #TheCabin today. And I thought I'd post up the details of how my iPod lifeline, "Smart Shuffle" works. I call the playlist that because it's a true shuffle, but within the world I want to give it.&lt;/p>&lt;p>So here we go.&lt;/p> &lt;p>To begin with, this is really just for your iPod, not for your full library on your computer. So let's pretend you have a completely empty iPod.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Create a static playlist (my term for a playlist you drag and drop songs into to make a list of songs, not a smart playlist) called "Add To iPod". Start adding things to it that you'll want on your iPod.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;br /> &lt;img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061021.jpg"
width="418" height="154" alt="200804061021.jpg" />&lt;/p> &lt;p>Go to town.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Next create a smart playlist called "Most Played". Make it look like this.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;br /> &lt;img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061025.jpg" width="480" height="181" alt="200804061025.jpg" />&lt;/p> &lt;p>Next create a smart playlist called "Random". Make it look something like this.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;br /> &lt;img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061026.jpg" width="480" height="275" alt="200804061026.jpg" />&lt;/p> &lt;p>It'll give you random songs you haven't listened to recently, isn't something you've already selected to put on your iPod manually (Add to
iPod list) and haven't skipped (maybe you don't like it?), but also isn't an old favorite you listened to a lot (In your most played). So you'll get some songs maybe you've never heard before, and you might really like.&lt;/p> &lt;p>On the opposite side, create one called "Recently Played" to look like.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;br /> &lt;img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061029.jpg" width="480" height="184" alt="200804061029.jpg" />&lt;/p> &lt;p>Next create a smart playlist called "New Music". Make it look like this.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;br /> &lt;img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061027.jpg" width="480" height="185" alt="200804061027.jpg" />&lt;/p> &lt;p>So any
of your new albums will always be around.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Create another playlist called "iPod Sync" that'll be your "master" sync list to your iPod. Have it encompass other lists you've created. It can look something like this.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;br /> &lt;img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061033.jpg" width="480" height="301" alt="200804061033.jpg" />&lt;/p> &lt;p>Make sure that list (and other playlists you've created) are selected in the playlist sync tab in iTunes when your iPod is plugged in.&lt;/p> &lt;p>And then off to make the final "Smart Shuffle" playlist.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;br /> &lt;img src="http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/200804061036.jpg" width="480" height="346"
alt="200804061036.jpg" />&lt;/p> &lt;p>So you'll end up with tracks that aren't a Podcast, that aren't really long, but not really short. Actually have Artist and Track names to display, fit within all the other playlists you've created (that live within the iPod Sync list), isn't something that you've skipped recently (obviously you didn't want to listen to it). And you can add other things as well.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Enjoy!&lt;/p></p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
