Threw up in a garbage can right in the hallway."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="I threw up at Cloverfield"><meta name=twitter:description content="Just a quick update to tell everyone that I threw up at Cloverfield last night.
