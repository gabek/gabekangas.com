I sent out a blast email (and myspace post) today to everyone letting them know of my time table. I hope to squeeze every bit of excitement out of this place before I go. And i'll try my hardest to blog it all.</p><p>Tonight I'm meeting up with Katie and Tracy at the Green Eye. Tracy used to live in Omaha, so i'm using her as a really helpful resource. Katie said Frank is going to go too, I'm excited!!</p><p>Tomorrow night I think i'm going to (shamelessly) meet up with Garnet to watch Desperate Housewives.</p><p>Oh speaking of Garnet.. her and I went to a sushi place last night. I actually had sushi, first time ever. It didn't really do it for me, but it was probably because I was petrified. But I did have a lot of fun, and we were both proud of me for trying it. I'd go again.</p><p>And since i'm throwing stuff in that i've been doing... last Sunday I went to the Hideout Block Party with Rachel and had a great time watching some great bands. Even saw 100 random people dressed as zombies do the dance from Thriller. You don't get that in Nebraska.</p><p>My first trip to Omaha is scheduled Oct 9th - 14th. They're getting me a corporate credit card, so that'll be really nice that I don't have to front any cash through this process.</p><p><img width=320 height=214 alt=200809272039.jpg src=http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/200809272039.jpg></p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
