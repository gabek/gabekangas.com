I was focusing on the playback engine, something I've never done a deep dive into before.  As a side effect of Swift being new, and C# being new to me, this means I developed in two new languages in under a year and a half on a daily basis.  So again, that's something.</p><p>I may be the only person who received an offer from Pandora who feels about 50/50 if they will accept it or not.  I always told people Rdio is about as large of a company as I'd want to be at.  When I started I think it was just around 150 people.  It's probably closer to 200 globally now.  Pandora touts 1800+ employees.  I asked representatives to explain how I won't get lost in a sea of engineers.  They couldn't tell me I wouldn't.  They couldn't tell me I'd matter.</p><p>There's a possibility I'm more touchy about this than the rest of my team because this is the second time I've been acquired in two years.  Maybe I feel like I'm being pushed around with no control over my own destiny.  That I can be bought and sold to the highest bidder.  I don't actually feel this way, I can walk away at any time.  But the fact that it's come to mind at all means there might be something to it.</p><p>Rdio's shutdown isn't just a loss to me, or the people I share an office with every day.  It's a loss to the world of music.  Rdio was the service for music lovers, by music lovers.  In this world of The Streaming Services vs. The Music Business it's not enough to love music to keep the lights on.  There's no guarantee Pandora can do any better.  They're the ones, prior to their IPO, who were petitioning the copyright royalty board every few years saying they'd go out of business if rates were hiked up.  They're trying to pay less to artists.  The same artists who are already trying to put the streaming services out of business.  So I'm not sure how this can end well.</p><p>Regardless of any of this, Rdio will be a thing of the past soon.  A story about a fantastic product sold in a fire sale because the music streaming industry is brutal.  But I'm really lucky to have been a part of it, even for a short time.  Goodbye, Rdio.  You had too much empty whitespace.</p><p><code>{=html} &lt;iframe width="500" height="500" src="https://rd.io/i/QFCpL6v4nA/" frameborder="0"></code> <code>{=html} &lt;/iframe></code></p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
