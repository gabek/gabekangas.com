If you didn't see the photos, you may not have even known I had gone at this point.
I'll make that rundown quick. Daft Punk was a life changing, unbelievable experience. It was the show of shows. Read any review of lolla for Friday and you'll only hear the same thing over and over. Amazing.</p><p>!!! on Sunday took 2nd place in putting on a great show. I really liked hearing the new tunes, including Heart of Hearts, and seeing the new vocal addition to the band. They put on a really powerful performance and had the crowd drawn in the whole time.</p><p>I missed half of Ghostland Obvservatory's set on Friday due to showing up a bit late, but they put on the same show as always. I really like them. Hope to see them again soon. Powerful, danceable tunes.</p><p>LCD Soundsystem, after me talking about them non-stop for like two+ years I finally saw. And to be honest, kind of a let down. Not all they are cracked up to be live. And that's ok. They come off as a really good rock band with some synth's in person. They lose some of the energy in person, but I was still really happy to finally see them.</p><p>Also saw Satellite Party, who put on a good set with Perry singing Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros cover songs mixed in with their originals. Sound Tribe Sector 9, who sounds like a MIDI file. CSS didn't show due to a missed flight, that really sucked. Cold War Kids, who I knew would be a snooze... were a snooze. M.I.A. can rock a house. Patti Smith, even though she's like 100 can still be pissed and sing songs about it to a lot of people who want to hear her. It was a good set, and I'm glad I got to see her. Interpol put on a really clean show. It was nothing special, but the music was good and as a crowd we were into it. Amy Winehouse, I really didn't like. But I knew I wouldn't. And I mixed in watching sets of Modest Mouse, My Morning Jacket, Flosstradamus, Apostle of Hustle, TV on the Radio... and many more.</p><p>I didn't see Pearl Jam. After three days, and everyone wanting to go see one single band all at once at the end of it all, I just wasn't interested. If you were there you really wouldn't blame me.</p><p>I was going to post about other things other than Lollapalooza too, but I think this is enough for right now. Maybe later?</p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website. It's better this way.</p></section></footer></main></body></html>
