I agreed. However, I figured i'd take the high road and save her some money from having to contact her attorney again. I had enough fun with that the first time. Wait, she's quite wealthy now after her windfall. Damn. I missed out on some potential fun!</p><p>Oh well. So the last remaining option was to grab a new car. So I did. 2007 Chevy Aveo. It has an Aux in jack for my iPod, and that's probably the best feature. Oh, that and it has two aux power jacks, and the Scion only had one. That means I can plug more crap in. That's important.</p><p>See below for photo of the model.
