I couldn't get the stupid "reset password" thing to work on aim.com, so I figured now was as good of a time as any just to sign up a new name again. My buddy lists get so long and crapped up with random people every 4 years or so it's good just to start over anyway.</p><p>So go ahead and throw "TheGabeKangas" on your buddy list.</p><p>Of course, after I decided to create that name I did a grep through some old apache logs and saw that password I forgot in a HTTP GET request for that code I was working on. So whatever, i'll keep both of them logged in :)</p><p>Had to go into work tonight. It kinda sucks having to make that extra trip there, but what needs to be done needs to be done.</p><p>Ok, off to bed. I really need my sleep. But a wise man once said "You can sleep when you're dead." Oh wait, that was MDFMK i'm thinking of. Oh well.</p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website. It's better this way.</p></section></footer></main></body></html>
