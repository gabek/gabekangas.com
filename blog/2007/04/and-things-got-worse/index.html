Point blank, out. Find somewhere else to live. She was screaming at me on the phone and said some really awful things. She told me that I took advantage of her mother's death. I don't even know what that means. So I left, and came back to get stuff to move it out of the house. When I got home the house full of smoke. Just completely filled. It was near impossible to breathe. She was burning so much incense that it had engulfed the whole house. She lit it in the two rooms I spend time in. The room I sleep in, and the room where my computer goes. That's no coincidence, she wanted to make sure I didn't come back. She knows I have problems breathing, so that's how she did it. Poor cats and dog had to deal with that all night.</p><p>I went to grab some clothes and to my surprise they were covered in potting soil. Yes, potting soil. It looks as if she took some from the plant in the computer room and threw it all over my clothes. If I hadn't seen this with my own eyes I would had never believed it. The same soil was piled on top of my bluetooth apple keyboard on the desk. It's ruined.</p><p>I didn't think of taking pictures of that, and I'm stupid. I should have. I did think of taking a picture before moving the stuff in the driveway, since I knew i'd be writing this post today.</p><p>I was so afraid what I didn't move was going to be destroyed. I don't have much right now, but I do have some belongings that are mine. And I completely was convinced that by the end of the night I would not have those anymore either.</p><p>So here's most of my audio, computer, and network gear. All packed up as best as possible in the driveway.<code>&lt;span style="font-size: 0pt"></code>{=html}<code>&lt;/span></code>{=html}</p><p><a href=http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/IMG_8730.JPG><img src=http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/IMG_8730-tm.jpg alt="Img 8730">{width="133&rdquo; height="100&rdquo;}</a><code>&lt;span style="font-size: 0pt"></code>{=html} <code>&lt;/span></code>{=html} <a href=http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/IMG_8731.JPG><img src=http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/IMG_8731-tm.jpg alt="Img 8731">{width="133&rdquo; height="100&rdquo;}</a></p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
