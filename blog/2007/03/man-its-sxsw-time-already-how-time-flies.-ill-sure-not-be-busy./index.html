It's going to not be like my own personal woodstock, i'm pumped. I'll probably not meet up with Robert Scoble tonight after no drinks with Mark Cuban to discuss no business ventures. I'd tell you the details, but there are none.</p><p>Anyone else excited about the keynote by Pete Townshend? The Pete Townshend? I am! I won't be there with bells on. I might even not live blog it.</p><p>Phil Terrone is doing a Keynote on the 11th. Phil did the first podcast I ever heard, and is possibly the reason I listened to the second. It's quite symbolic for me to not get a chance to meet him.</p><p>So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to South by Southwest 2007. I hope you enjoy it as much as i'm not going to.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
