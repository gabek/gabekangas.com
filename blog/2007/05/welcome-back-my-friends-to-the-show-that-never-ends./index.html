Kelley filed a restraining and gag order against me. That means no talking about the divorce, at all, in any manner. On top of that after it's all over, the restraining order kicks in and says I can't post to my blog, at all, mentioning the divorce. Or that I was ever married, or anything.</p><p>Kind of dumb, isn't it? Well, I'm back and I'm taking care of those issues now.</p><p>The posts are back, so go ahead and read the back story and catch up if you've missed it. The reasons I took down the posts in the first place, and stopped posting was the fact that Kelley was going at the whole blogging in such a broad way that anything I posted, dealing with her or not, could be used against me and say it causes her "intentional emotional distress". I could say "I got a new toaster today", and she could say that's me insulting the fact she gave me a toaster in the divorce settlement, and then take me to court for breaking the order. Do you trust she wouldn't do that? Me neither.</p><p>This blog is is so my friends and family can follow me in my life. It's not for me to gain any kind of advantage in any pending legal issues as Kelley said. I've had this web site for well over 10 years. I'm pretty sure I didn't even know her then. Yeah, I didn't. I checked.</p><p>So i'm sorry i've been away. It was certainly not my intention. I was just trying to save myself as much as possible from the litigation happy ex.</p><p>I'm so glad you could attend. Come inside, come inside.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website. It's better this way.</p></section></footer></main></body></html>
