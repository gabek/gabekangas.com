There's a problem though, an a rather large one. I don't want to. There's just too much going on, and i'm unable to focus on a large project like that at the present time. It's really bothering me.
I mean, there's no timeline, so there's really no problem. It's my own thing, and there's nobody chomping at the bit to listen to this stuff. But I think it's good, and I really want people to hear it, I just can't get myself to finish it. I'm a really different place now than I was not so long ago in so many ways, and it's really difficult to try to force yourself back into that mindset.</p><p>I don't know, I know breaks from this stuff is good from me. History has shown me that when I leave my music for a duration of time I come back to it with a clear head and I look at it differently. Generally when you work on anything for a long time you start caring about the details and not the big picture. And that's always true in projects i'm involved in.</p><p>So hopefully soon I can figure out what it takes to get back in front of that desk and finish this stuff. There's so much to come i'm really excited about.</p><p><a href=http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/IMG_8765.JPG onclick="return window.open('http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/IMG_8765.JPG','popup','width=2592,height=1944,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0'),!1"><img src=http://www.real-ity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/IMG_8765-tm.jpg height=100 width=133 border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Img 8765"></a></p><p>See, i've even started wiring things up!</p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
