I could watch episode after episode if I wanted to, but I'm not. Unlike LOST where when an episode ends you're left hanging and you'd do anything to see the next, with Heroes i'm fine that it's ended and I close the player instead of grabbing the next to see what happens. Oh well.</p><p>Stay r33t.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website. It's better this way.</p></section></footer></main></body></html>
