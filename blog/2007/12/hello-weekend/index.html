I haven't really had a lot of time to post an update lately. But I always say that, and so do most people with blogs.</p><p>This is the first weekend in a while where i'm at home. I've been spending a lot of time off doing stuff. Last weekend, believe it or not, I was in Racine for the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilties_Drum_and_Bugle_Corps>Kilties</a> banquet. Dawn invited me to go with her, and I used the opportunity to donate my uniform back to the corps. It's been sitting in my closet since 2004 when I last marched. But time heals and I think things between me and the corps are much better now.</p><p>Being at their rehearsal on Sunday made me really want to march again. It's so easy when there to think that's something I should do. Everyone telling you that you should march, and seeing everyone with their instruments. At more than one point I almost caved and signed up. But I know with my job it's not a good idea, and I really would be giving up all this freedom that i've come to enjoy these past months. I still need to do my own thing before I agree to be part of someone else's larger vision. It would be great to be under the direction of <a href="http://www.dci.org/about/fame/view_member.cfm?member_id=4c7886bb-c538-4e5c-84b5-199290382247">Scott Stewar</a>t, though. He rocks. It was a real honor to meet him in person at the banquet. Dawn
laughed at my giddy schoolgirl approach at meeting a drum corps legend.</p><p>Speaking of Dawn, we've been spending a lot of time together even though she moved to Michigan. It's only 2hrs away, so it's not a huge deal. It's not much different than driving up to the Northern suburbs. I drove her home from the banquet last weekend. Due to bad weather I stayed there Monday and just worked remotely. Had a lot of fun with her and her roommate, Ron. We hung out while Dawn slept sunday night, was a good time.</p><p>Today I have a list of things to do. Laundry, clean apartment, and work on music. I already placed a big order through drugstore.com in order to blow some of my flex spending cash I have left. Lots of cough drops, claritin, and other random stuff i'm sure i'll need throughout the year. So i'm stocked up for a while.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website. It's better this way.</p></section></footer></main></body></html>
