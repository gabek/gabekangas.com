And it it's even longer when it's in feet of snow. I was exhausted by the time I got home. I was ready to crash.</p><p>But the amount of snow waiting for me in the driveway was crazy, I couldn't even park my car legally. So I spent another 45min or so shoveling and trying to beat off the cramps that keep popping up due to my lack of physical ability.</p><p>So here I am finally able to go to bed and I can't, i'm just too worked up.
