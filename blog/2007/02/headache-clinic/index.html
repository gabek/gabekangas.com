There's a place in chicago called the <a href=http://diamondheadache.com/>Diamond Headache Clinic</a>. Being i've been on another bad downswing with the whole migraine thing i'm thinking I should see someone else... again. Not that I haven't seen enough people in the past, but it hasn't helped all that much. One thing I have got out of my neurologist is the wonderful drug of <a href=http://www.relpax.com/>Relpax</a>. You take one when you feel it coming on, and it takes about 2hrs to kick in. But it works almost all of the time, it really is a life saver. Previously i'd have to stay home instead of going somewhere, now I have something that can help. The problem is I don't have a way to prevent them from coming on, and I can only get 6 pills of Relpax at a time for insurance reasons. I do take a pill every night, but it doesn't really seem to do anything.
I'll think about it.</p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website. It's better this way.</p></section></footer></main></body></html>
