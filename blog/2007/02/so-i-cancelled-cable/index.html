I got pissed at Comcast once and for all. My plan was to cancel cable and just download shows through the new Amazon Unbox + TiVo setup or through the <a href=http://www.apple.com/appletv/>Apple TV + iTunes Store setup</a>. I spent to much on my new TiVo that I figured it would work great as a media download appliance, but Amazon doesn't have much of selection compared to iTunes.</p><p>I'm just trying to find ways to free myself from the companies telling me how I should be spending my money. I don't have enough money as it is, so it really bothers me when it goes somewhere when i'm not convinced it's what I want to be spending it on. Lifetime, Oxygen, Hallmark Channel, Golf TV, ESPN, all things I don't want my money to go to.</p><p>So i'll give this new deal a shot for a month, but i'll probably cancel it still. I'm willing to go without TV completely just to not have to deal with them and be a part of the empire. I'll pay my $2 a week to watch LOST, another $2 for South Park, etc.</p><p><em>($2 * # of Shows) * 4 weeks in a month &lt; What i'm paying comcast</em>.</p><p>And freedom is priceless.</p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
