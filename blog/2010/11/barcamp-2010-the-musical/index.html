I thought about that a while (at least 2 to 3 minutes) later that day (today) and thought I'd see if I could pull something off.  So here's an attempt to get a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session>jam session</a> rocking at Barcamp.</p><p>So here's a call to all Barcamp participants who have access to any kind of simple, acoustic, portable instrument that is jam-able (hammered dulcimer, Roland 808: maybe not so much.  Think hand drum, acoustic guitar, rain sticks, stand-up bass, iPhone, didgeridoo, you get the idea.)</p><p>And don't worry, I already talked to @lasertron about a way to do it so speakers don't get upset: she suggested to have it at lunch!</p><p>This is informal, and it'd be cool for as many people to join in who are willing.  If you have any extra gear at home that might be appropriate for this, bring it!  I'll bring what I have as well.</p><p>Tell your friends!</p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
