 Yes it is.  And that, my friends, shows you that it's been kind of a down year when it comes to tunes for me.  (Don't get me wrong, I really like that song.)</p><p>For some reason "Shiny Toy Guns" was a staple this year as well.  But that's some feel-good, fun time poppy dance tunes that I can't go wrong with.  So who would blame me?</p><p>If you look at albums I've listened to the most, I think it's a pretty good list.  We start with Blaqk Audio's SexCells, as mentioned before.  A couple soundtracks, including <em>Repo!  The Genetic Opera.</em> And the <strong>awesome</strong> comedy album by The Lonely Island, Incredibad.</p><p>Also as far as albums we have that new album by Ghostland Obervatory I mentioned, The Dance Macbre Remix album by The Faint, Daft Punk's Discovery, and Battles' Mirrored.</p><p>I've heard Battles in previous years, but it was just this year I got their album "Mirrored", and it's really great stuff.  Highly recommended.</p><p>To close things out I'll point you to songs that I've been recommending, as they are a great example of music I've loved at that point in time.  So seriously head over to <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a207e4b0fd42afd1a05d/1355981319443/?format=original">http://gabekangas.com/musicrecommendations</a> to hear some tunes.</p><p>I know this post wasn't very deep or anything, but hey.  What do you expect?</p><p>Below I'll embed a few sources of tunes probably mentioned above, and you can partake if you like.  Enjoy!</p><p><img src="http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEyOTE1OTczNTMxMjYmcHQ9MTI5MTU5NzM2MDQ*NSZwPTE4MDMxJmQ9Jmc9MSZvPTcwNDZlNWRjNTc*OTRhYTY5ZTRj/NTkwZGU2ZjQwY2I3.gif" alt>{width="0&rdquo; height="0&rdquo;}<code>&lt;embed src="http://assets.mixpod.com/swf/mp3/mixpod.swf?myid=73077306&amp;amp;path=2010/12/05" quality="high" wmode="window" bgcolor="292018" flashvars="mycolor=292018&amp;amp;mycolor2=3E4D2C&amp;amp;mycolor3=2E6344&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;rand=0&amp;amp;f=4&amp;amp;vol=100&amp;amp;pat=0&amp;amp;grad=false" width="410" height="311" name="myflashfetish" salign="TL" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" border="0" style="visibility:visible;width:410px;height:311px;"></code>{=html}<code>&lt;/embed></code>{=html}<br><a href=http://www.mixpod.com/playlist/73077306><img src=http://assets.mixpod.com/images/btn2-tracks.gif alt=Music title="Get Music Tracks!"></a><a href=http://www.mixpod.com><img src=http://assets.mixpod.com/images/btn2-create.gif alt=Playlist title="Create Your Free Playlist!"></a><a href=http://www.mixpod.com/user/20877160><img src=http://assets.mixpod.com/images/btn2-profile.gif alt="View Profile" title="View all my playlists!"></a>\ Create a <a href=http://mixpod.com>MySpace Playlist</a> at <a href=http://mixpod.com>MixPod.com</a></p><p><code>&lt;embed style="width:400px; height:380px;" id="FeedPlayerAudioStandard" align="middle" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.bigcontact.com/feedplayer-standard.swf?r=0&amp;amp;xmlurl=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds%252efeedburner%252ecom%2Fgaberecommends" quality="best" bgcolor="#ffffff" scale="noScale" wmode="window" salign="TL" flashvars="initialview=info&amp;amp;autoplay=no&amp;amp;standalone=no&amp;amp;share=no&amp;amp;repeat=no"></code>{=html} <code>&lt;/embed></code>{=html}</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
