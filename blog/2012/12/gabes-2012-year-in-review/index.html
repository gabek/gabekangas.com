<strong><a href=http://www.evernote.com>Evernote</a></strong>.<br>I'm not sure why I pay for Evernote.  I should stop.  I use it plenty, but not enough to require the paid plan.  It's my cloud-based dropbox of text that I always know is accessible everywhere.  I use it for everything from todo lists, to just sketching down notes.\</p><ul><li><strong><a href=http://getcloudapp.com/>Cloud.ly</a></strong>.<br>Such a rad service.  I have a little menu item that sits there waiting for me to drag something on it, and when I do it uploads it and copies the URL to my clipboard.  As simple as that.  It'll also auto-upload screenshots.  It works great and I use it a ton every day for sending files around to people.\</li><li><strong><a href=http://www.hover.com>Hover</a></strong>.<br>My domain registrar of choice.  It used to be the old "Tucows Domains" from the day, but rebranded.  It's a simple, clean service.  If you think about what the complete opposite of GoDaddy would be, it would be Hover.\</li><li><strong><a href=http://www.fastmail.fm>Fastmail</a></strong>.<br>I continue to use Fastmail.fm as my email provider.  I pay them every year to do nothing but accept email and make it accessible to me.  They're not going through my email and selling the data to the highest bidder, and aren't trying to make me into a webmail convert.\</li><li><strong><a href=http://www.dropbox.com>Dropbox</a></strong>.<br>Dropbox is kind of like the working directory of my life.  All documents, code, images, etc hang out here.  It's nice to know all my stuff is accessible from anywhere I happen to be.  Throw something in there and then grab it again from my iPhone or at work.\</li><li><strong><a href=https://testflightapp.com>Testflight</a></strong>.<br>TestFlight makes the life of any iPhone developer easier.  I use it both personally and professionally to send out test versions of applications I'm working on.  Without it the test process for normal users is a little more convoluted than you'd like, but using Testflight it's fast and easy.  Plus they add things like bug reporting, checkpoints and install reporting.  For free.\ \</li></ul><p>Hardware ========</p><ul><li><strong><a href=http://www.apple.com/iphone>iPhone 5</a></strong>.<br>The upgrade from the iPhone4S to the iPhone5 was one of the bigger ones.  It's substantially faster and the screen is a great size.  The memory bump in it makes a huge difference as well, as apps that are "in the background" take a lot longer to get killed by the OS.  Something I launch before work now is still alive when I go home.</li><li><a href=http://www.klipsch.com/image-one-on-ear-headset></a><strong><a href=http://www.klipsch.com/image-one-on-ear-headset>Klipsch Image
ONE</a></strong> headphones.\ The pair of headphones I've had for years, and really liked, a set of Sennheisers, finally reached their end this year so it was time to find a new pair.  I figured I'd use the Apple Store as my venue of choice to try out different options, since they had them physically there and it was easy to return if needed.  I tried a couple different ones and returned them.  I even thought I'd give a brand I wouldn't normally try, Skull Candy, a shot.  For your future reference the "Aviators" were awful.  Just awful.  More proof that headphones associated with a rapper (Jay-Z in this case) are bad.  Anyway.  I really like this pair of Klipschs.  They are over the
ear, light, and mobile.  Perfect for my commuting and listening at work needs.</li><li><a href=http://www.apple.com/appletv/><strong>AppleTV</strong></a>.<br>Next to my iPhone my AppleTV is the piece of hardware I use the most.  I purchase current shows through iTunes.  I stream movies through Netflix.  New movies I rent through iTunes.  If I wanted to use Hulu, that's there as well.  I've amassed a digital library of episodes of my favorite shows I can watch at any time, and I often do.  It's also a great AirTunes receiver where I send it music from Spotify from my Macbook Pro, iPhone or iPad to fill my apartment with tunes.  This piece of hardware is the most underrated Apple product, and I'm a fan.</li></ul><p>Misc ====</p><ul><li><strong><a href=http://www.1800gotjunk.com/>1-800-Got-Junk</a></strong>.<br>When I moved from Omaha to SF I had a ton of stuff I didn't know what to do with.  I hate selling things, so I figured I'd offer everything I had to friends, and anything left would just get disposed of.  1-800-Junk to the rescue.  They showed up with a truck and took everything I pointed out into their truck, and then charged me less than I expected to pay.</li></ul><p>Media/Music and Podcasts ========================</p><ul><li>These are the podcasts I'm currently subscribed to:</li></ul><ol><li><a href=http://twit.tv/tnt>Tech News Today</a>.  A daily podcast detailing a

ton of really new stuff that I listened to.  A lot of stuff that's just "new to me".  I can say the new Blaqk Audio album was way rad, and I listened to that a ton.  Also the first full length album from Stepdad was something I recommended to people.  Marilyn Manson came back with a vengeance with the new album "Born Villain , I enjoyed that quite a bit.  And last, but not least, Mark Mallman's epic adventure "Double Silhouette" is a masterpiece.  My favorite Mallman album, and that's saying a lot.  I feel like he's taken the songwriting and construction of these songs in a new direction that I really like.  That on top of the obvious attention to detail of the production quality makes it a must listen.\ Anyway,
here's a list of songs I've listened to a lot in the past year with the help of Last.FM keeping track of that for me.</p><p><code>{=html} &lt;iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:gabek:playlist:0G51wrl7DtdXkdw4gs32SO" width="600" height="280" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></code> <code>{=html} &lt;/iframe></code> Here are some older year in reviews to compare if you'd like.</p><ul><li><a href=http://gabekangas.com/2009/11/gabes-tools-of-the-trade>2009</a> - <a href=http://gabekangas.com/2007/12/gabes-2007-review-of-stuff>2007</a> - <a href=http://gabekangas.com/2006/12/end-of-year-wrapup-2006>2006</a> - <a href=http://gabekangas.com/2005/12/end-of-the-year-wrapup>2005</a></li></ul></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
