Inspired by <a href=http://www.ninthdivision.com/blog/2009/10/barcamp-omaha-2009-was-a-success/>Andy Peter's Barcamp Omaha talk</a> I thought I'd share some  non-obvious things I use to do things on a daily basis.  I like to share.  Do you?  Have a cookie.</p><p>Apps for Mac OS X =================</p><p><a href=http://dropbox.real-ity.com/GEKdock.jpg><img src=http://dropbox.real-ity.com/GEKdock.jpg alt title="My Dock">{width="538&rdquo; height="34&rdquo;}</a></p><p><a href=http://xtralean.com/IWOverview.html>ImageWell</a> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>I use ImageWell almost daily.  It's a simple graphic capture and upload tool.  You configure a couple FTP/webdav/drive locations and you can capture selections or the whole of your screen.  Or take an image file and just drop it onto the icon.   Hit "Send" and it uploads it to that location and puts the URL of the file in your clipboard to paste wherever.  In fact that's how I captured my dock that's shown above.  You can do some simple editing such as crop, watermark, some little filters as well.  It's so stupid easy that I couldn't imagine not having it.  I have mine configured for my mobileMe and Flickr accounts.</p><p><a href=http://www.dropbox.com>Dropbox</a> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>I just actually recently started using Dropbox.  It's really simple way to have a folder sync'ed with all your other machines, and even your iPhone.  For me this includes documents and code.  I really like developing on my desktop, but when I'm at a coffee shop and want to pick up where I left off with my MacBook Pro the code is sitting right there.  I'm also planning on migrating my iTunes library (the data file, not the actual music) to my Dropbox so every machine has an up to date version.  I'll let you know how that works out.</p><p><a href=http://macromates.com/>TextMate</a> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>If you code on a mac, and it's not an Xcode project, TextMate is the editor to use.  At least that's what I've found.  I really love it.</p><p><a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/xchataqua/>X-Chat Aqua</a> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>As an avid IRC'er I've tried every IRC client on pretty much every platform.  Windows, OS X, *nix GUI and console, iPhone, Palm OS, BeOS, you name it.  The client I keep coming to is the free X-Chat.  It's simple and highly scriptable.  On my mac it's how I keep in touch with my IRC friends around the world on a daily basis.</p><p><a href=http://www.panic.com/transmit/>Transmit</a> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>If you do work on the internet you need a good FTP client.  Transmit is my favorite.  I pair it with TextMate when editing files live on a server.  Double click, edit in TextMate, save, Transmit sends the updated file back up automatically.  That's how life is supposed to work, folks.</p><p><a href=http://www.evernote.com>Evernote</a> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>I use this constantly as a cloud-based location for any snips of text that I ever need.  Addresses, phone numbers, code, things grabbed from web sites, anything.  I just drag and drop from Safari right into Evernote on the dock and lo and behold it's right there on my iPhone when I need it.  This is especially great when I'm going somewhere and I need an address.  I just drag it from Google to Evernote, and then open it up on on my iPhone later when I need it in the car.  It's free, but there's a paid pro version as well.  I paid for it because it's just that cool.  I didn't get it at first, but now that I do... I'm glad.</p><p><a href=http://culturedcode.com/things/>Things</a> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>I'm a bit of a poser here.  I have Things, and I sometimes use Things.  I'm currently trying to force myself to put everything in Things and stop relying on short term memory when it comes to prioritization and execution.  I think Things will become more useful coming up here in the short term, and I'll let you know how it goes.  Personally I think the reason why I haven't been able to go 100% Things is the fact I'm forced to a Windows desktop most of the time because of my current job.  Sure, I have my iPhone.  But I find it hard reaching for my iPhone to do things when I'm already at a keyboard.  I have the iPhone and OS X Desktop versions.  They sync, and they're easy to use.</p><p>iPhone Apps ===========</p><p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a020/1355981318725/?format=original"><img src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a023_1355981318737__ alt="My iPhone" title="My iPhone">{.size-medium .wp-image-1406 width="200&rdquo;

I don't even want to think about it.  Don't quote me on this if some day I have to end up using Quickbooks.</p><p><a href=http://brizzly.com/>Brizzly</a> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>My web Twitter client of choice.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
