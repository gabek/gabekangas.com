As a young boy I shot a squirrel for no reason. I still feel bad about it.\ 2. I'm an activist for marriage reform. Something with such a high failure rate obviously has a flaw.\ 3. A web app I once built was in PC World magazine as one of the "best of the web". I was so proud.\ 4. I get upset when I have to use Windows at work. It's like being tasked to cook a whole meal with only a lighter.\ 5. I love coffee.\ 6. People see me as young in Chicago, and old in Omaha. Therefore I feel young in Chicago, and old in Omaha.\ 7. Growing up I would perform at least two theatre shows a year, mostly musicals. I started at age seven with Fiddler on the Roof.\ 8. My favorite number is 8.\ 9. I respect people for their music taste more than I
should.\ 10. I'm an atheist, but I used to teach Sunday school in a Lutheran church.\ 11. I started an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel that's been running for almost 15 years with many of the same people.\ 12. I wish I could get into reading. There's so much good content that I don't give myself access to.\ 13. I would love to be a professional musician in some fashion. But I know I'd never be good enough.\ 14. I haven't had meat in almost two months. I don't miss the food, I miss the convenience.\ 15. Before I turned 18 I did a lot of not so legal things online. It allowed me to learn programming languages, operating systems and network topology in a way school never could.\ 16. In high school I had a band that changed the lyrics
of a song from "Tell me about the time you fucked your mother in your living room" to get a gig at a christian coffee house. We still never played there.\ 17. I never saw someone use chewing tobacco until I met someone from Omaha.\ 18. I once hosted a top ranked Podcast. But I altered the rating system to rank us that way.\ 19. I miss drumming.\ 20. I once wanted to be a hobo. Given the options I thought it would be the most freeing and the best opportunity to start fresh.\ 21. Being in a drum corps was some of the most fun I ever had. Until I started to care more about winning.\ 22. I swore off celebrating Christmas with my family after this past holiday.\ 23. Without Twitter (and a couple other sites) i'd have no friends in Omaha. I'm
so thankful for the sites and the friends.\ 24. I'm listening to The Cars - "Just what I needed" right now.\ 25. I told myself I wouldn't do this, but after enough people tagged me, and reading Katie's, I figured I owed it to them. There's a lot my new friends don't know about me. This is like a cheat sheet.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website. It's better this way.</p></section></footer></main></body></html>
