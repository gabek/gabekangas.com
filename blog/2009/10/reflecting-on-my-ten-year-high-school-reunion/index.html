<a href=/blog/2009/09/ten-year-class-reunion/>Everyone knows I didn't know what to expect</a>.  But now that the Grant Community High School class of 1999 reunion is over I can't help but look at those four years far different than I did before.  I'll be honest and tell you that I really did discount that time.  It wasn't awful, but I was glad it was behind me.  But now after reuniting with my friends for the first time in ten years I realize things were quite different than I remember them.</p><p>I forgot how amazing my friends were in high school.  Smart, passionate, creative, extremely fun people.  Obviously I know I had a good time with them, but I forgot the details.  I guess time can do that.  I forgot all of that "silly fun" we used to have.  The singing in the car, the dancing like an idiot.  All the inside jokes.  And it came back right away.  Immediately.  We all picked up where we left off.</p><p><object classid=clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000 width=425 height=344 codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name=allowFullScreen value=true>
