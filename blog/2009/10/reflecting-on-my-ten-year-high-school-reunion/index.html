height=&ldquo;274&rdquo;}</a>We immersed ourselves in the soundtrack of the 90s.  The boy bands, the pop rock, the Lilith Fair superstars.</p><p>The only thing different is that we could legally drink with each other now.  Something none of us partook in during the high school years.   Our group was too busy with rehearsals and performances to go party like many may have in their four years.  We discussed how others would have parties and sneak in beer or wine coolers, where that was always the last thing on our minds.  We had no interest in it.<a href=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3460/3970190519_b3c012a697.jpg><img src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3460/3970190519_b3c012a697.jpg alt>{.alignright width=&ldquo;234&rdquo; height=&ldquo;175&rdquo;}</a></p><p>Our favorite teacher showed up to the reunion.  Something he's never done before.  He felt we were a special group and he wanted to see us all again.  To celebrate we took part in a 10 person shot.  Who would have thought ten years later I'd be buying my teacher a drink.</p><p>I wish I could have spent more time with Amanda Glassford <a href=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2563/3970191749_3f6e5a8ed5.jpg><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2563/3970191749_3f6e5a8ed5.jpg alt>{.alignnone width=&ldquo;26&rdquo; height=&ldquo;18&rdquo;}</a>, who never graduated from Grant due to a family move, but always felt that it was her home.  And Jill <a href=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2506/3970961138_1c0cd626e4.jpg><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2506/3970961138_1c0cd626e4.jpg alt>{.alignnone width=&ldquo;22&rdquo; height=&ldquo;16&rdquo;}</a>who I lived near for years after moving to Illinois.  I hadn't talked to her even online in the ten years since graduation.  And Amanda Perryman who just recently joined Facebook and I was able to say hi to again.</p><p>So all in all was it a good experience?  No, it was an amazing experience.  It makes me wish the past ten years would have had these people in my life more than they were.  Even though we've all scattered across the country I've never made an attempt once to see any of them, ever.  And to make it worse, maybe due to having internet access to them at any time I wanted: I didn't feel the need to.</p><p>Now I do.  I miss them, and that's a good feeling.</p><p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642/50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23/50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a017/1355981318654/?format=original"><img src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_50d2a206e4b0fd42afd1a01a_1355981318671__ alt=GCHSatDinos2009 title=GCHSatDinos2009>{.size-medium .wp-image-1365 width=&ldquo;300&rdquo;
