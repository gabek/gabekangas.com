I can't help but look back to a <a href=/gabes-digital-life-1/2008/08/hellooooo-omaha>simple blog post I made on August 1st, 2008</a>. I wrote "Do I want to move to Omaha? Not really." Now flash forward to May 2009 where my journey in Omaha has so little to do with the reason I came here in the first place.</p><p>It's mostly about the people for me. From the second I stepped foot on Omaha's soil it's been a non-stop experience of meeting the greatest people ever.</p><ul><li>I land in October, to visit. I immediately get a text message from <a href=http://www.narcissica.com/>Jess</a>, "Welcome to Omaha." From that moment I never felt more welcome somewhere.</li><li>A couple days later <a href=http://www.myspace.com/sccrgrl2002>Jillian </a>helps me find a place to live in Dundee.</li><li><a href=http://smellypuppy.com/>Boutcher </a>introduces me to everyone at the office and invites me to a party thrown by <a href=http://www.phildietz.com>Phil</a>.</li><li>I meet <a href=http://twitter.com/geekyfemme>Kat </a>for coffee and I'm glad to know someone who wants to talk geekery with me. She introduces me to drag queens.</li><li>I meet Cassie who shows me how the city likes to have fun and in turn I get to show her how Chicago does when we visit my friends there.</li><li>At my first Tweetup I introduce myself to the infamous <a href=http://twitter.com/k_to_the_t>KT</a>, who has since become a very close friend and a source of inspiration both socially and professionally.</li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=63209123&ref=mf">Andrea </a>becomes my partner in crime any time either of us want to go out, or there's a show.</li><li>I meet <a href=http://www.dustyd.net/>Dusty</a> <a href=http://www.siliconprairienews.com/>and</a> <a href=http://www.slobotski.com/>Jeff </a>who show me that I can be a part of something in Omaha that would never be possible in Chicago.</li><li>Becoming friends with <a href=http://twitter.com/incognito1027>Christin </a>makes me realize that I can share things and be important to someone else's life just like so many have become important to mine.</li><li>I learn when I go out with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=63202841&ref=mf">Terah</a>, <a href=http://twitter.com/obrewan>Bree</a>, and <a href=http://twitter.com/valerienoelle>Valerie </a>there's going to be some awesome tunes played on the jukebox. We'll sing "Tom Sawyer" multiple times.</li><li>I become a real part of a neighborhood. Knowing if I go to "my bar", <a href=http://www.myspace.com/49rlounge>The 49r</a>, I'll see people I recognize.</li><li><a href=http://www.kandy.net/>Krin </a>sucks because she moved to Chicago. Wish she could have stuck around longer.</li><li>In no other world would <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1545495035&ref=mf">Schaft</a>, otherwise just "the bartender", be a friend of mine outside of a pint of Boulevard.</li><li>I can walk to "my coffee shop" and see that <a href=http://www.princesslasertron.com/>Megan </a>is just down the street. I can go say hi and <a href=http://twitter.com/lasertron/status/1689301321>share some ice cream and conversation</a>.</li><li><a href=http://twitter.com/bspersonal>Brian</a> shows me how fun and awkward it could be for a few guys who have no clue what they're doing to <a href=http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2601/128/113/690609344/n690609344_1441636_7322896.jpg>throw themselves into the public promotions game</a>.</li><li><a href=http://twitter.com/daveloyall>Dave </a>and <a href=http://twitter.com/secos>Matt </a>help me debug issues with my web site on IRC. The difference here is I know I'll see them in a couple days and I'll buy them a beer to thank them.</li><li><a href=http://www.bigomaha.com>BigOmaha</a></li></ul><p>There's so many other people, places, and experiences that I'm missing. But this isn't meant to be some kind of all encompassing list of everyone that I know. Just a snapshot of some really important people that have made the six months probably the best six months of my life.</p><p>Thanks, Omaha.</p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
