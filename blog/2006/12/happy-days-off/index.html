I've been off so far this week, and this is my last day off. Wanted to blow some vacation days before I lose them. Wish I could carry some over, but I can't. Oh well.</p><p>Been spending most of the time on music. Most of it really sucks, so I find myself wanting to spend more and more time making it not suck. I'm generally unsuccessful.</p><p>But there are a lot of things going on in a handful of songs, so I think i'm getting somewhere.</p><p>Beck said before releasing his most recent album that new releases from artists should combine not only the audio of a new CD, but videos, mashups, remixes, and the ability to customize the experience to the user. I agree with all of that. Even though I don't think DJ Tiesto will be knocking on my door anytime soon to do a remix to any of my tracks, there are communities online that enjoy remixing other people's work. I'll see if I can get involved. Plus I hope to have some music videos ready when the music is done. I'd love to have other people involved in that too, but it takes a lot of time.</p><p>New YouTube video of my antics behind the mixer went up last night. Enjoy.</p><p>So that's that. Back to work!</p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website. It's better this way.</p></section></footer></main></body></html>
