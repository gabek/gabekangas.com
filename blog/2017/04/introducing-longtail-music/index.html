while.  Ever since
<a href=http://gabekangas.com/blog/goodbye-rdio>Rdio shut down</a> I've
listened to less music on mainstream services.  While I do have a
<a target=_blank href=https://open.spotify.com/user/gabek>Spotify account</a>, I tend to only use it to listen to old playlists and comfort music.</p><p>Where music discovery has been successful for me, however, is with
internet radio.  Having a person with deep knowledge within a certain
style hand-picking tracks for me every day has proven time and time again
that it's a system that works.</p><p>I built
<a target=_blank href=http://thebatplayer.fm>The Bat Player</a> as the
best way to listen to your favorite internet radio stations on your
television. It's a client for power-users where you can add any station.
 But I wanted to facilitate an experience for a wider audience that
wouldn’t already have stations lined up to listen to.</p><p>There’s no lack of internet radio directories.  Many boast “thousands of
stations” with no context or assistance for a perspective listener.  If
you’re lucky you’ll be linked to a web site for a station to learn more,
many looking like they haven’t been touched since 1998.  There had to be a
better way.  So I built
<a target=_blank href=https://longtail.fm>Longtail Music</a>.</p><p>I focused on a specific set of stations that met a standard of quality and
ultimately resulted in me directly reaching out and inviting them on
board.  My goal was to create a “loosely connected network of independent
stations”.  The content on these stations is really great and I’m honored
to have met all of the station owners who care deeply about their slice of
music online.</p><p>With stations in place the first hurdle for a potential listener is
determining what station to listen to. Longtail’s feed helps here.  Feeds
are how people consume content every day with bite-sized chunks scrolling
by on every network.  Browsing the feed gives you easily digestible
snapshots of what is taking place allowing the style, personality and
content of stations to come out.  What they’re playing, events being
scheduled and reactions from listeners are all analogous to what is seen
every day on Facebook and should feel like home.</p><p>Instead of simply stating a certain genre is played, the actual content of
the station is featured.  It’s the difference between that person you met
who says “Yeah, I love music. It’s cool!” and the one who says “I only
listen to
<a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzaha_W-S5k">early Ministry</a>
and
<a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRu7Pt42x6Y">Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac</a>”. You'll know what you’re going to enjoy if you get the specifics
upfront.</p><p>We live in a predominately single-dominated world. But listening to that
one song and forgetting about it isn’t how you discover new music. Instead
you hear a new song, track it down so it can be listened to obsessively,
and then dig through the artist’s catalog to see what other stuff you’ve
missed out on. I want to facilitate that workflow.  That’s why every song
is only a click away from being played on Spotify, the largest on-demand
music service. So visit the list of songs you’ve “Liked” and add them to
your playlists, dig through the back catalog, and listen on-demand again
and again. Each song is a gateway to an entire artist, entire genre, or
entire world of music you may not even have known about.</p><img src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_58fe7121e58c62bd9738a939_1493257152215_Screen+Recording+2017-04-24+at+02.40+PM.gif+PM.gif_ alt=" Click on tracks to navigate to them in Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music and more. ">
Click on tracks to navigate to them in Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music and
more.<p>I hope I’ve made it clear so far that music is not a zero sum game.  There
is room to have both the Spotify Discover Weekly playlist algorithm and
personal curators shoveling a steady flow of musical coal into your audio
consumption furnace. Because of this interoperability is a thing I’d like
to continue to focus on.  That’s why on Longtail you can do things like
use your Facebook or Spotify account to get a list of suggested stations.</p><p>I wanted what I call a “thin social layer”.  Real-time, live, internet
radio is a shared experience and that aspect should be emphasized.
 Knowing others are turning in and listening with you is a cool feeling.
 “Liking” a track isn’t just a meaningless gesture to keep track of songs
for yourself, it tells fellow listeners what you think, potential
listeners the content that is drawing attention, and is even a datapoint
for the DJ to know the feelings of the listeners.</p><img src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_58fe87d78419c2a722df8140_1493257043289__img.gif_ alt=" Longtail Music's full screen player.  See in real-time other people tuning in or reacting to tracks. ">
Longtail Music's full screen player.  See in real-time other people tuning
in or reacting to tracks.<p>And lastly, I'm not just doing this for the listeners.  Internet radio
stations have been hiding in the shadows as long as I can remember, doing
its best to keep the lights on, keeping up with licensing payments,
hosting fees and more.  I wanted a convenient, centralized way to collect
donations from listeners.  So if a station enables it you can help keep
the tunes flowing by "Tipping" them and I'll make sure it gets to them.</p><p>It’s early days with Longtail Music, but I’d like to thank everyone who’ve
supported the idea so far, including all the stations who have given
feedback, suggestions, and encouragement.</p><img src=/squarespace_images/static_50ce21f9e4b0a7200de38642_50d2a1a4e4b0fd42afd19a23_58f1a6e7579fb3353292b4d7_1493257030129__img.jpg_ alt=" Thanks to  Jay Demetillo , who came up with the overall look and feel of the site.  He was a huge help in giving structure and style to everything.  This is him and I at Covo working on Longtail.

Thanks to Jay Demetillo , who came up with the overall look and feel of the
site.  He was a huge help in giving structure and style to everything.  This
is him and I at Covo working on Longtail.<p>Give <a target=_blank href=https://longtail.fm>Longtail Music</a> a
shot.  Maybe you'll find something you'll be really into.  Need a
suggestion?  How about
<a target=_blank href=https://longtail.fm/stations/lowercase-sounds>Lowercase Sounds</a>.  Today is their 12th anniversary of streaming their brand of house
music online.  If you missed out on the past 12 years make sure you don't
miss out on all the fantastic music being shared online by people like
Très and his crew in the future.</p><p>Let me know what you think.</p></body></html></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website. It's better this way.</p></section></footer></main></body></html>
