I wanted to say something to them. While I didn&rsquo;t, it got me thinking, what if?</p><p>What if I actually stopped to say something? Would it turn confrontational? Would they ignore me? What if I had an encouraging, positive, standardized statement that said &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re really fucking good at your job. You have options. You can do what you do anywhere&rdquo;. What if it were printed on a little card that I could just give people so they don&rsquo;t try and hit me. What if the card had statements from people smarter, and more influential than I encouraging these talented people to put their skills to use elsewhere?</p><p>The thoughts started to balloon. What if there were a recruiter attached who&rsquo;s specializing in trying to get these Facebook employees to interview elsewhere? Or employers who&rsquo;s willing to fast-track Facebook employees to an on-site interview? While these are real, tangible things, they wouldn&rsquo;t really help here. Facebook employees, in theory, get reached out to by hiring representatives every day so they don&rsquo;t need special treatment. They already have options. But I don&rsquo;t know what kind of tangible things you could offer somebody working there that would make them feel like it&rsquo;s worthwhile to go a different direction. <a href=https://mashable.com/article/facebook-employees-react-teen-spying-app-blind/#eNEWhq8YHaqK>Is money, truly, all that matters to Facebook employees?</a></p><p>Everyone has worked somewhere they&rsquo;re not 100% proud of, but with an organization such as Facebook I think we&rsquo;re seeing employees doubling down on their choice because the alternative is that they work for somewhere truly evil, and that&rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow. Every Facebook employee is part of the problem, but they don&rsquo;t have to be. They can leave and do amazing things. Things that don&rsquo;t require waiting for a bus to Menlo Park or enabling the demise of democracy.</p><p>If you worked somewhere that you knew at your core was not positive for humanity what are some things that people could say to you to make you feel like it&rsquo;s ok to move on and do something else? How do you support them in stopping what they&rsquo;re doing without coming off as judging them?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is just a thought experiment, or if it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s actually ethically possible to pursue. But if you have ideas on how we can encourage Facebook employees to go do something else, let me know by <a href=https://mastodon.social/@gabek>pinging me on the Fediverse</a>.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>I simplified my website.
