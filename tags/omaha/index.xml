On Friday, February 3rd I'll have relocated to San Francisco. When looking back at the past three years it's hard to decide what to put in this rather long retrospective post. But I'll use it as my last opportunity to highlight, clarify, give thanks, and try to explain why I'm taking on this new adventure.
I moved to Omaha thinking I'd have to dodge cows on the way to the office every day.</description></item><item><title>Barcamp Omaha 2010 was rad (and the jam was fun)</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/11/barcamp-omaha-2010-was-rad-and-the-jam-was-fun/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2010 16:41:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/11/barcamp-omaha-2010-was-rad-and-the-jam-was-fun/</guid><description>Thanks to the organization team of Barcamp2010 here in Omaha it was another great event. Learned some stuff and had some fun. Also thanks to everyone to indulged me in my attempt for a lunchtime jam session. I can't honestly say it was the most musical thing ever performed, but we all had fun anyway :) Thanks to everyone who took part! It was nice to mix things up a bit.</description></item><item><title>Gabe Kangas Association for Awesome is proud to sponsor Omaha Bar Camp 2009</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/09/gabe-kangas-association-for-awesome-is-proud-to-sponsor-omaha-bar-camp-2009/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2009 00:53:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/09/gabe-kangas-association-for-awesome-is-proud-to-sponsor-omaha-bar-camp-2009/</guid><description>The Gabe Kangas Association for Awesome (GKAFA) is proud to announce they will be sponsoring this year's Omaha Bar Camp.

So I think it's time for a new social experiment.
Currently I follow 340 people on Twitter. Some of them are automated entertainment sources, many of them are out of the area.</description></item><item><title>My interview about Retweet Thursday</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/07/my-interview-about-retweet-thursday/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2009 11:29:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/07/my-interview-about-retweet-thursday/</guid><description>Well who would have thought? The fine people over at Silicon Prairie News were interested in talking to me about the weirdest meme to ever hit Twitter (aside from #MufasaMonday I suppose), #retweet_thursday. They told me they weren't sure who was behind it at first, but figured out it was out of Omaha somewhere, so they pinpointed it to me. I never really made it public that the bot was run by me, but I wasn't really hiding the fact either :)</description></item><item><title>My BIG post on BIGOmaha</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/my-big-post-on-bigomaha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2009 16:26:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/my-big-post-on-bigomaha/</guid><description>I'm not going to talk about what Big Omaha was, or was not in the "Big Omaha brought the counties best and brightest creative blah blah blah" type thing. I'm not going to write much about what the speakers had to say. I'm going to tell my tale of the first ever Big Omaha conference and the parts that mattered to me. This will probably be long and spread with random photos.</description></item><item><title>Six months of being an Omahan ( #bigomaha )</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/six-months-of-being-an-omahan-#bigomaha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2009 15:48:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/six-months-of-being-an-omahan-#bigomaha/</guid><description>So this week marks six months of living in Omaha. I can't help but look back to a simple blog post I made on August 1st, 2008. I wrote "Do I want to move to Omaha? Not really." Now flash forward to May 2009 where my journey in Omaha has so little to do with the reason I came here in the first place.
It's mostly about the people for me.</description></item><item><title>A quick catch-up post</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/a-quick-catch-up-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2009 10:21:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/a-quick-catch-up-post/</guid><description>I opened my blog editor here with an idea of what to post. Then I got side tracked, and I no longer remember what it was I planned on talking about. So instead this is just going to be a catch-up post. Sorry about that. I bought a new camera the other day. With BIGOmaha coming up I needed a way to document the event, so off to Nebraska Furniture Mart I went.</description></item></channel></rss>
