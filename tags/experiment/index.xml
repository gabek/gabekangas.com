My sanity has been questioned. I've even been told that the idea was all just a part of Skynet's plan for world domination. But I can now proudly say that &amp;quot;the experiment&amp;quot; (or The Creepy Twitter Experiment) can be executed successfully without death or even serious injury. As a refresher: I wrote a script to pick a person completely randomly from people I follow on Twitter. I wanted to meet those who we mutually follow, but never met.</description></item><item><title>A new social experiment</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/08/a-new-social-experiment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2009 11:18:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/08/a-new-social-experiment/</guid><description>If you remember back I recently had #TweetDinner. Where people a web site decided who my &amp;quot;closest friends&amp;quot; were all got together for dinner and hung out. It was a good time, I consider it a success. It doesn't hurt that they were cool people. So I think it's time for a new social experiment.
Currently I follow 340 people on Twitter. Some of them are automated entertainment sources, many of them are out of the area.</description></item></channel></rss>
