And who knows how long it would have stayed as a draft, but Keith Flint of The Prodigy died this week, and given how much I owe to The Prodigy being one of my earliest electronic loves, I felt I should actually publish it.
My music taste and the different artists that I've listened to throughout my life is a big part of my identity.</description></item><item><title>Reflecting on my ten year High School reunion</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/10/reflecting-on-my-ten-year-high-school-reunion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2009 00:55:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/10/reflecting-on-my-ten-year-high-school-reunion/</guid><description>I didn't originally want to go. But to everyone who told me I should: Thank you. Everyone knows I didn't know what to expect. But now that the Grant Community High School class of 1999 reunion is over I can't help but look at those four years far different than I did before. I'll be honest and tell you that I really did discount that time. It wasn't awful, but I was glad it was behind me.</description></item><item><title>Ten year class reunion</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/09/ten-year-class-reunion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2009 07:05:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/09/ten-year-class-reunion/</guid><description>Wow, ten years since I graduated high school. Many probably will say &amp;quot;it seems like only yesterday&amp;quot; but to me it seems much, much longer. In fact, to be honest, I hardly remember those four years at all. Sure some special moments stand out that included performances or things with friends, but on the whole... really, nothing. I wasn't planning on going to the reunion. It wasn't until my friend Becky from high school asked me to go did I cave and signed up and booked a flight.</description></item></channel></rss>
