She asked some others if they'd be willing to join her, and here I am. I'm not so bold to think I'll actually blog every day this month, but I'll try.
Enough of that, here's #1. @lasertron writes:

What were you doing five years ago today?</description></item><item><title>Welcome to the new face of Gabe</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/04/welcome-to-the-new-face-of-gabe/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2009 01:27:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/04/welcome-to-the-new-face-of-gabe/</guid><description>Real-ity.com has a long standing history. One that I don't take lightly. &amp;quot;Gabe's Digital Life v3.1337&amp;quot; at real-ity.com was born five or so years ago. Before that it was another, much more simple blog. And before that, collections of links. This dating all the way back to 1997. As my friend BobbyT once said, &amp;quot;I was blogging since it was just called updating a web site.&amp;quot;
But with the culture of the internet as it is, I felt the need to change with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
