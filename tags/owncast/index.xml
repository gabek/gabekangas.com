There&amp;rsquo;s been some significant traction lately, so I wanted to take a moment to write an update.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been making steady progress under the radar with a fantastic group of people who have discovered the project. We knew that once we completed our Owncast web admin feature that we&amp;rsquo;d let a few more people know about the status of things, since it&amp;rsquo;s an added level of polish and ease of use that might appeal to people.</description></item></channel></rss>
