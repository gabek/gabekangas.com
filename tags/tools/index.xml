I've missed some years, but I think I have more new stuff this time around. I'll try and detail all of the software, hardware and services that I've used this year to make my personal and professional life better or more interesting.\
Software ========
Desktop (OS X) Xcode.
Love it or hate it, I live in it. Actually, I don't know if I love it or hate it.</description></item><item><title>Gabe's tools of the trade</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/11/gabes-tools-of-the-trade/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2009 14:45:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/11/gabes-tools-of-the-trade/</guid><description>This isn't the first time I've made a post like this. In fact I used to make a yearly recap of all the tools, software, hardware, etc that made me productive that year. For whatever reason I didn't this past year. Not sure why. Guess I was busy hanging out with you or something. Inspired by Andy Peter's Barcamp Omaha talk I thought I'd share someÂ non-obvious things I use to do things on a daily basis.</description></item></channel></rss>
