They were going to hand pick a handful of people and bring them in for the event. I honestly kind of forgot about it, and I really only did it as one of those &amp;quot;take advantage of opportunity because you never know&amp;quot; kind of things that I'm trying to be proactive about.</description></item><item><title>TechStars for a Day, startup culture, and my comparisons to Omaha</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/05/techstars-for-a-day-startup-culture-and-my-comparisons-to-omaha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2010 13:52:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/05/techstars-for-a-day-startup-culture-and-my-comparisons-to-omaha/</guid><description>Alright, stay with me. I promise you'll get something at the end. I don't promise you'll like it, though. I attended TechStars for a Day in Seattle. If you want to know what this rockin' organization does check it out. But in short, they are a business accelerator. Get your company off the ground in the most awesome way possible.
It seemed like a classic case of serendipity. I was behind the controls at Big Omaha helping the speakers tell their inspiring stories when an email invite came in from TechStars to join them in Seattle to hear more about the program and to give them an opportunity to meet me.</description></item><item><title>I survived South by Southwest Interactive 2010</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/03/i-survived-south-by-southwest-interactive-2010/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2010 00:36:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/03/i-survived-south-by-southwest-interactive-2010/</guid><description>Writing a wrap-up post about South by Southwest I would imagine is similar to writing about being teleported to another universe for a short time. A universe where there are no words that a human can make to explain the things they saw. So in that vein let me tell you that it was so.&amp;hellip; yeah. Thanks everyone, have a great weekend.
Alright, I'll give this a shot. It was everything I thought it could be, and more.</description></item><item><title>Gabe takes on South by Southwest Interactive 2010</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/03/gabe-takes-on-south-by-southwest-interactive-2010/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2010 19:26:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2010/03/gabe-takes-on-south-by-southwest-interactive-2010/</guid><description>One of the things I've convinced myself of in this past year is that if there's something I want to do, then I should do it.{.alignleft .size-medium .wp-image-1523 width=&amp;quot;218&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;quot;240&amp;rdquo;} Sounds simple right? But not so much. In this particular example, South by Southwest, it's something I've wanted to attend for years. But instead of just deciding I was going to go I wallowed in my cube and read/watched what was going on in the week long center of the world.</description></item></channel></rss>
