They are usually pretty casual about things, but they mentioned the kid has to go to bed at 8pm.
8pm comes around and the movie the kid is watching has 5 minutes left. I think most people would let the kid watch that 5 minutes. Common sense says if they are a good kid who isn&amp;rsquo;t actively trying to break the rules it&amp;rsquo;s probably fine and doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt anybody.</description></item></channel></rss>
