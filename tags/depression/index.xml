Things that I don't see I don't believe. Things that don't make sense I don't assume to be true. Faith isn't really a thing I take part in, and I do things when I see a reason to. I let logic determine my decisions in life, but unfortunately there's circumstance where not only do I let that slide, but it goes completely in the other direction.</description></item></channel></rss>
