They involved things that didn't make sense to me. Either making things, or interacting with people. Christmas parties, neighbors, etc. I didn't have any of these and I felt pretty lame. So instead I figured i'd write this blog post about 2010. I wish I could say I have a lot of detailed things to talk about that happened in the past year, but I really don't.</description></item></channel></rss>
