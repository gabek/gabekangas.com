To start, here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist of my favorite songs of the year that you can listen to while reading this post.

My sanity has been questioned. I've even been told that the idea was all just a part of Skynet's plan for world domination. But I can now proudly say that &amp;quot;the experiment&amp;quot; (or The Creepy Twitter Experiment) can be executed successfully without death or even serious injury. As a refresher: I wrote a script to pick a person completely randomly from people I follow on Twitter. I wanted to meet those who we mutually follow, but never met.</description></item><item><title>Admiral Ackbar joins Twitter</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/08/admiral-ackbar-joins-twitter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2009 15:39:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/08/admiral-ackbar-joins-twitter/</guid><description>Per recommendation of @EternalCow I built a bot that puts a much needed appearance of Admiral Ackbar (@AdmiralAckbar_) on Twitter. He's warning (as he should be) to all who will listen that &amp;quot;It's a trap!&amp;quot; This is funny, but the most entertaining part is the fact that people are replying back.
See below for a real time update of responses to &amp;quot;It's a trap!&amp;quot;
I'll soon have itsatrap.org up :P</description></item><item><title>A new social experiment</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/08/a-new-social-experiment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2009 11:18:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/08/a-new-social-experiment/</guid><description>If you remember back I recently had #TweetDinner. Where people a web site decided who my &amp;quot;closest friends&amp;quot; were all got together for dinner and hung out. It was a good time, I consider it a success. It doesn't hurt that they were cool people. So I think it's time for a new social experiment.
Currently I follow 340 people on Twitter. Some of them are automated entertainment sources, many of them are out of the area.</description></item><item><title>My interview about Retweet Thursday</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/07/my-interview-about-retweet-thursday/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2009 11:29:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/07/my-interview-about-retweet-thursday/</guid><description>Well who would have thought? The fine people over at Silicon Prairie News were interested in talking to me about the weirdest meme to ever hit Twitter (aside from #MufasaMonday I suppose), #retweet_thursday. They told me they weren't sure who was behind it at first, but figured out it was out of Omaha somewhere, so they pinpointed it to me. I never really made it public that the bot was run by me, but I wasn't really hiding the fact either :)</description></item><item><title>Closest friends of Gabe #tweetdinner</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/06/closest-friends-of-gabe-#tweetdinner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2009 22:01:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/06/closest-friends-of-gabe-#tweetdinner/</guid><description>I'm certainly on a kick lately of wanting to take part in some social experimentation. So when this idea came to mind, I couldn't pass it up. The other day I jumped on a new Tweeter stats type thing. There's hundreds of them. This one is twitteranalyzer.com. After it analyzed my online social circle it determined who my &amp;quot;closest friends&amp;quot; were. Although all awesome people, they're not the people I've spent the most time with.</description></item><item><title>How to communicate, by Gary Vaynerchuk</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-communicate-by-gary-vaynerchuk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2009 18:54:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-communicate-by-gary-vaynerchuk/</guid><description>What great conversation between Gary Vaynerchuk, the internet and I today. There's something invigorating about a really constructive conversation where you come out of it feeling better about the topic than when you went in. While it's a great business and brand technique, the world would in general be a much better place if it happened more often. Gary reached out to me after reading my blog post that I had Alex (@alexpgates) check out, and wanted to clear up any miscommunication with me, and everyone else on how he's seen or interpreted.</description></item><item><title>My BIG post on BIGOmaha</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/my-big-post-on-bigomaha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2009 16:26:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/my-big-post-on-bigomaha/</guid><description>I'm not going to talk about what Big Omaha was, or was not in the &amp;quot;Big Omaha brought the counties best and brightest creative blah blah blah&amp;quot; type thing. I'm not going to write much about what the speakers had to say. I'm going to tell my tale of the first ever Big Omaha conference and the parts that mattered to me. This will probably be long and spread with random photos.</description></item><item><title>Breaking news: Big Omaha proves how awesome Gabe is</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/breaking-news-big-omaha-proves-how-awesome-gabe-is/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2009 00:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/breaking-news-big-omaha-proves-how-awesome-gabe-is/</guid><description>Big Omaha is a success. No doubt. The friendships that were built, the inspiration that filled multiple venues. It's a story that will be retold many times for the next year. But the real story took place online yesterday, when it was discussed how really awesome I am. Names hidden to protect the innocent.
[17:56] &amp;lt;OldFriend1&amp;gt; NewFriend from omaha? [17:56] &amp;lt;NewFriend&amp;gt; yep [17:57] &amp;lt;NewFriend&amp;gt; we met at the Big Omaha thing [17:57] &amp;lt;OldFriend2&amp;gt; ohhh [17:57] &amp;lt;OldFriend2&amp;gt; what did you think of gabe?</description></item><item><title>Six months of being an Omahan ( #bigomaha )</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/six-months-of-being-an-omahan-#bigomaha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2009 15:48:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/six-months-of-being-an-omahan-#bigomaha/</guid><description>So this week marks six months of living in Omaha. I can't help but look back to a simple blog post I made on August 1st, 2008. I wrote &amp;quot;Do I want to move to Omaha? Not really.&amp;quot; Now flash forward to May 2009 where my journey in Omaha has so little to do with the reason I came here in the first place.
It's mostly about the people for me.</description></item><item><title>A quick catch-up post</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/a-quick-catch-up-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2009 10:21:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/a-quick-catch-up-post/</guid><description>I opened my blog editor here with an idea of what to post. Then I got side tracked, and I no longer remember what it was I planned on talking about. So instead this is just going to be a catch-up post. Sorry about that. I bought a new camera the other day. With BIGOmaha coming up I needed a way to document the event, so off to Nebraska Furniture Mart I went.</description></item><item><title>Tweetup #4</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/04/tweetup-#4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2009 09:29:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/04/tweetup-#4/</guid><description>Omaha Tweetup #4 is over. All together, not bad. But certainly the curve his heading downward in the &amp;quot;coolness&amp;quot; chart. It seems as it gets more successful, in better venues, the less charm the event has.
The first tweetup had about 40 people there. It's the first time I met a lot of great people. Not only people I'd start following on Twitter for the first time, but people that are now friends of mine.</description></item><item><title>Tweply and SMS</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/03/tweply-and-sms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2009 11:43:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/03/tweply-and-sms/</guid><description>Happy post Saint Patrick's day. So maybe I was optimistic (or pessimistic, depending on how you see it) about Tweply and SMS functionality. Like other projects I've thrown together I felt a need that I couldn't find elsewhere, and then offered it to others. Except this time it's costing me more than I expected with people signing up for it.
I love that people find it useful, but unfortunately I'm paying much more than I expected.</description></item><item><title>Tweply - since nobody talked me out of it</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/02/tweply-since-nobody-talked-me-out-of-it/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2009 00:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/02/tweply-since-nobody-talked-me-out-of-it/</guid><description>I was hoping someone would talk me out of another stupid idea. Damn you all. So this is what you get. An alpha thingy of Tweply. http://www.real-ity.com/tweply/
No promises how well it'll work, but it should work ok. It looks ugly. Well.. actually it looks more like nothing. That's how my design skills are. Couple header tags, a center, some text and not close out the body.
Again, you have to give out your twitter password to use it.</description></item><item><title>I'm going to make a thing for twitter</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/02/im-going-to-make-a-thing-for-twitter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2009 00:33:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/02/im-going-to-make-a-thing-for-twitter/</guid><description>Anyone who knows me knows I'm addicted to Twitter. I won't go into details of my love affair with the beautiful beast, but let's just say it's a pretty integrated part of my lifestyle work flow. However, there's things I wish it did that it doesn't do. It's not very flexible.
For example, you can send tweets from people you follow to your phone via SMS, and that's a great feature.</description></item></channel></rss>
