This is where a large group of my friends are. All types of people from all over the world.
But lately the topic of respect and seniority has been brought up more and more often.</description></item><item><title>Breaking news: Big Omaha proves how awesome Gabe is</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/breaking-news-big-omaha-proves-how-awesome-gabe-is/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2009 00:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/05/breaking-news-big-omaha-proves-how-awesome-gabe-is/</guid><description>Big Omaha is a success. No doubt. The friendships that were built, the inspiration that filled multiple venues. It's a story that will be retold many times for the next year. But the real story took place online yesterday, when it was discussed how really awesome I am. Names hidden to protect the innocent.
