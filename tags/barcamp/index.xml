Learned some stuff and had some fun. Also thanks to everyone to indulged me in my attempt for a lunchtime jam session. I can't honestly say it was the most musical thing ever performed, but we all had fun anyway :) Thanks to everyone who took part! It was nice to mix things up a bit.</description></item></channel></rss>
