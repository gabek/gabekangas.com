As you can see, I went through with it. Let me explain a bit of the process, and my rationalization behind it all.
I last did a major refresh of my web site about 6 years ago where I went from self-hosting a Wordpress blog to moving everything over to Squarespace.</description></item><item><title>My 2018 in review</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2018/12/my-2018-in-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 20:53:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2018/12/my-2018-in-review/</guid><description>I figured enough has taken place this year, enough changes have taken place, and I’ve worked on enough projects that a post recapping things might be worthwhile. To start, here’s a playlist of my favorite songs of the year that you can listen to while reading this post. So what did I do with this year? It seems, looking back, I wrote a ton of code.</description></item><item><title>Your internet sucks.</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2018/07/your-internet-sucks./</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:53:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2018/07/your-internet-sucks./</guid><description>I've been very disheartened with the internet recently. Between Twitter's Nazis and Facebook's data collection, ad policies and democracy manipulation, I've begun to feel like the internet that I loved was gone. And as more people almost exclusively spend time using services that are run by corporate entities, these services are systematically killing off third party access to their contentin order to lock you into an experience that they control.</description></item><item><title>Why your tech stack matters (It's not why you think)</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2018/02/why-your-tech-stack-matters-its-not-why-you-think/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 17:32:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2018/02/why-your-tech-stack-matters-its-not-why-you-think/</guid><description>Recently I've received a lot of messages from recruiters looking for an iOS developer to build with React Native. And while I generally don't care what technologies people are selecting to build their products, I find this to be a subject that I think warrants a deeper dive. But a disclaimer up front: I have a bias, and I only speak for me, not for any team I'm currently or have been a part of.</description></item><item><title>Goodbye, Rdio</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2015/11/goodbye-rdio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2015 17:41:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2015/11/goodbye-rdio/</guid><description>Like everybody else, I felt like I had heard every song on Pandora by the time I discovered Rdio. I was user number 4075, a paid unlimited user, signing up on June 6, 2010. I was really happy to hear anything I wanted. I used the Rdio Desktop client to create a collection on the service with my local iTunes Library. I listened to it a lot.</description></item></channel></rss>
