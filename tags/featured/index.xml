As you can see, I went through with it. Let me explain a bit of the process, and my rationalization behind it all.
I last did a major refresh of my web site about 6 years ago where I went from self-hosting a Wordpress blog to moving everything over to Squarespace.</description></item><item><title>My 2018 in review</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2018/12/my-2018-in-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 20:53:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2018/12/my-2018-in-review/</guid><description>I figured enough has taken place this year, enough changes have taken place, and I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on enough projects that a post recapping things might be worthwhile.
To start, here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist of my favorite songs of the year that you can listen to while reading this post.

I was user number 4075, a paid unlimited user, signing up on June 6, 2010. I was really happy to hear anything I wanted. I used the Rdio Desktop client to create a collection on the service with my local iTunes Library. I listened to it a lot.
Like many others, I moved to Spotify once it finally came to the US.</description></item></channel></rss>
