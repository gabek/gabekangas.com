I can't help but look back to a simple blog post I made on August 1st, 2008. I wrote &amp;quot;Do I want to move to Omaha? Not really.&amp;quot; Now flash forward to May 2009 where my journey in Omaha has so little to do with the reason I came here in the first place.
It's mostly about the people for me.</description></item><item><title>Next step... there is no next step.

I've been thinking about that a lot lately. What is my next step? And I don't mean personally, or professionally.</description></item></channel></rss>
