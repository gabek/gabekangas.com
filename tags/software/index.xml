I wanted to give a bit of a postmortem to talk about what I sent out to do, what it did, and why I think things never worked out.
I originally built Longtail Music as a spinoff from my time with The Bat Player, an internet radio client for the TV. I thought if The Bat Player was a client for people who already love internet radio and know what they want to listen to, then I want to build something on the web for people to discover internet radio for the first time and discover a station they would love.</description></item><item><title>I'm discontinuing work on Mastochist for Mastodon</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2019/04/im-discontinuing-work-on-mastochist-for-mastodon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2019/04/im-discontinuing-work-on-mastochist-for-mastodon/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m no longer going to continue work on my Mastodon client, Mastochist. And even though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really impact anybody but myself, I felt I owed people a detailed explanation and apology since people have heard me talk about the work I&amp;rsquo;ve put in it for quite a while.
Mostly I owe an apology to Cara who I hired to design the look of the app, and she became my sounding board as I built out features.</description></item><item><title>Working with others on personal projects</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2019/02/working-with-others-on-personal-projects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2019/02/working-with-others-on-personal-projects/</guid><description>I like working with other people. I like having people to throw ideas off of, and having sanity checks for approaches I&amp;rsquo;m taking with things. I like the additional creativity that happens when you have another voice in the conversation and I like learning from people who know more about a topic than I do.
This is generally pretty difficult with personal projects. And for whatever reason many of my projects start with me using a technology I&amp;rsquo;ve never used before.</description></item><item><title>Gabe's tools of the trade</title><link>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/11/gabes-tools-of-the-trade/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2009 14:45:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabekangas.com/blog/2009/11/gabes-tools-of-the-trade/</guid><description>This isn't the first time I've made a post like this. In fact I used to make a yearly recap of all the tools, software, hardware, etc that made me productive that year. For whatever reason I didn't this past year. Not sure why. Guess I was busy hanging out with you or something. Inspired by Andy Peter's Barcamp Omaha talk I thought I'd share someÂ non-obvious things I use to do things on a daily basis.</description></item></channel></rss>
